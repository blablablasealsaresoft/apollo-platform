Overview of Ruja IgnatovaRuja Ignatova, often referred to as the "CryptoQueen," is a Bulgarian-born German national wanted by the FBI for her role in one of the largest cryptocurrency fraud schemes in history. She founded OneCoin Ltd. in 2014, a company based in Bulgaria that promoted a fake cryptocurrency called OneCoin. The scheme operated as a Ponzi-like multi-level marketing operation, with no actual blockchain or legitimate technology behind it. Instead, it relied on false promises, misleading representations, and aggressive recruitment to defraud investors worldwide. Estimates suggest victims lost over $4 billion, though some reports place the figure as high as $15 billion. Ignatova was the public face and top leader of OneCoin until her disappearance in October 2017.fbi.gov

The OneCoin ScamLaunched in 2014 alongside co-founder Karl Sebastian Greenwood, OneCoin was marketed as a revolutionary cryptocurrency superior to Bitcoin. Ignatova and her team made false claims about its value, technology, and market potential to solicit investments. Victims were encouraged to buy "packages" of OneCoin tokens via wire transfers, often through multi-level marketing networks that rewarded recruiters.Key facts about the fraud:No real blockchain existed; values were fabricated in a spreadsheet.
It targeted vulnerable groups, including farmers in Uganda who traded livestock for tokens, and communities in Somalia and elsewhere.
The scheme collapsed in 2017 after internal leaks and investigations revealed its fraudulent nature.
Co-conspirators like Greenwood were arrested; he received a 20-year prison sentence in the US. Ignatova's brother, Konstantin Ignatov, also faced charges and cooperated with authorities.

Ruja Ignatova Added to FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List
‘Cryptoqueen’ allegedly defrauded investors of billions

https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/ruja-ignatova-added-to-fbis-ten-most-wanted-fugitives-list

The FBI today announced the addition of Ruja Ignatova to its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Ignatova is being sought for her alleged leadership of a massive fraud scheme that affected millions of investors worldwide. Effective May 25, 2023, the FBI is offering a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to Ignatova's arrest. More information on the reward increase.

In approximately 2014, Ignatova and her partner founded OneCoin, a Bulgarian-based company that was marketed as a new virtual currency that would be the “Bitcoin killer.” Ignatova allegedly made false statements and representations about OneCoin to draw people to invest in OneCoin packages. According to investigators, Ignatova and her partner also promoted OneCoin through a multi-level marketing strategy that urged OneCoin investors to sell additional packages to friends and family.

Ignatova capitalized on the excitement surrounding cryptocurrencies to draw in new investors. While the company is said to have used many of the terms associated with virtual currencies, investigators believe that OneCoins were not mined in the way traditional to cryptocurrencies. In addition, the value of OneCoin was determined by the company rather than market demand.

“OneCoin claimed to have a private blockchain,” said Special Agent Ronald Shimko, who is investigating the case out of the FBI’s New York Field Office. “This is in contrast to other virtual currencies, which have a decentralized and public blockchain. In this case, investors were just asked to trust OneCoin.”

Throughout the scheme, OneCoin is believed to have defrauded victims all over the world out of billions. Shimko said Ignatova targeted individuals who may not have fully understood the ins and outs of cryptocurrencies but were moved by Ignatova’s impressive resume and the marketing strategies used by OneCoin.



On October 12, 2017, Ignatova was charged in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and a federal warrant was issued for her arrest. Investigators believe Ignatova may have been tipped off that she was under investigation by U.S. and international authorities. She traveled from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Athens, Greece, on October 25, 2017, and has not been seen since.

On February 6, 2018, a superseding indictment was issued charging Ignatova with one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and securities fraud.

Shimko hopes that the publicity of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list will bring more awareness to the case. “There are so many victims all over the world who were financially devastated by this,” Shimko said. “We want to bring her to justice.”

Ignatova is only the 11th woman to have been selected to be on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list in its 72-year history. She is currently 42 years old and has brown eyes and dark brown to black hair. Investigators, however, believe she could have altered her physical appearance.

Ignatova speaks English, German, and Bulgarian. She may be traveling on a fraudulent passport and has known connections to Bulgaria, Germany, Russia, Greece, and the United Arab Emirates. Shimko noted that before she disappeared, Ignatova lived a lavish lifestyle.

Ruja Ignatova: OneCoin is easy to use. OneCoin is for everyone. Make payments everywhere, everyone, globally. And this is who we are. Global citizens of a small world, wanting to make a change.

Monica Grover: That was Ruja Ignatova, talking back in 2016. Known as the CryptoQueen, she’s not only the co-founder of OneCoin ... but she’s also a recent addition to the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List.

On this episode of Inside the FBI, we’ll learn how Ignatova, through a company once marketed as the “Bitcoin killer,” didn’t change the world ... but instead robbed investors of billions of dollars.

I’m Monica Grover, and this is Inside the FBI.

* * *

In approximately 2014, Ruja Ignatova and her partner founded OneCoin, a Bulgarian-based company that was marketed as a new virtual currency but was allegedly a fraud scheme from the start. It hinged on getting investors—eager to get into the cryptocurrency space or maybe expand their cryptocurrency portfolio—to buy in.

Ignatova used a number of tactics to gain investors.

First, she targeted people who may not have fully understood the ins and outs of cryptocurrencies but were moved by her impressive resume, OneCoin's marketing strategies, and the excitement surrounding cryptocurrencies.

As part of that, OneCoin is said to have used many of the terms associated with virtual currencies but not the actual practices.

For example, investigators believe that OneCoins weren’t mined the way cryptocurrencies usually are, which is through computer resources.

And OneCoin claimed to have a private, centralized blockchain. So standard cryptocurrencies have a public, decentralized blockchain, which means its users can see all the transactions across the currency and that supply and demand determine the market value.

But OneCoin’s alleged private blockchain let only OneCoin—and not the investors—see any of the transactions. Basically, OneCoin the company served as the only regulator of the currency. And the value of the cryptocurrency was determined by the company rather than market demand.

Finally, Ignavota and her partner also even created a multi-level marketing strategy to encourage existing investors to sell OneCoin packages to their friends and family, who, after investing themselves, were then encouraged to do the same with their friends and family.

Iganovta succeeded in her scheme to recruit OneCoin investors. At that 2016 appearance in London, she bragged about the company’s user base:

Ignatova: You all know, since we mined our first coin in January 2015, our growth exploded. Sebastian and Kari showed us the numbers. Today, over two million users. Users means active users. Our database has easily more than 12 million entry points. But this two million are active users. And no other cryptocurrency has as many users as we do.

Grover: But those users, and others that came on board in later years, had no real way to track their OneCoin or the transactions across the currency.

At the end of the day, their OneCoin investments were worthless, and together, they lost the equivalent of more than 4 billion U.S dollars.

Just like with any type of scam, we always warn the public to be wary of secrecy. Any “investment” that is secretive in nature is probably a scam.

Additionally, investing your money based on someone’s personal talent or charisma, rather than underlying facts, is also a warning sign that you may be falling victim to a scam.

On October 12, 2017, Ignatova was charged in connection with the OneCoin fraud scheme, and a federal warrant was issued for her arrest. Investigators believe she may have been tipped off that she was under investigation. She traveled from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Athens, Greece, on October 25, 2017, and has not been seen since.

Ignatova is only the 11th woman on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, which was created in 1950.

She’s currently 42 years old and has brown eyes and dark brown to black hair. However, investigators believe she could have changed her physical appearance.

Ignatova speaks English, German, and Bulgarian. She may be traveling on a fraudulent passport and has known connections to Bulgaria, Germany, Russia, Greece, and the United Arab Emirates. She’s known to have lived a lavish lifestyle.

Ruja Ignatova Promotes OneCoin at London Event
Ruja Ignatova speaking about OneCoin at an event in London on June 11, 2016.

Video Transcript
It is really a pleasure for me to be here, one and a half years after we launched our cryptocurrency, OneCoin. I think today we spoke a lot about the network, the vision for the network. How big we want to be. But as always, I want us to remember what this network is about. 
 
This network was created to become and to fuel the growth of OneCoin, which I strongly believe will be the number one cryptocurrency worldwide. And the reason why I believe it is because I see all of you here. 
 
OneCoin is easy to use. OneCoin is for everyone. Make payments everywhere, everyone, globally. And this is who we are. Global citizens of a small world, wanting to make a change. 
 
So in the last two years, I have been called a lot of things. And probably the best thing that the press called me, was OneCoin, who is supposed to be the bitcoin killer. Well, I must say I like it. 
 
And… You all know, since we mined our first coin in January 2015, our growth exploded. Sebastian and Kari showed us the numbers. Today, over two million users. Users means active users. Our database has easily more than 12 million entry points. But this two million are active users. And no other cryptocurrency has as many users as we do.

A UK court ordered a global asset freeze for the ‘Cryptoqueen’ and her OneCoin associates
ICIJ previously found that OneCoin’s founder Ruja Ignatova and some of her associates had bought properties worth millions in Dubai while promoting the fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme.

A British law firm representing a group of OneCoin investors said that a London court has issued worldwide freezing orders on assets belonging to Bulgarian fraudster Ruja Ignatova and some of her associates, months after the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and its media partners revealed the promoters of the fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme invested in luxury properties in the United Arab Emirates.

International authorities have accused Ignatova of being the mastermind of a $4 billion pyramid scheme that has claimed more than 3.5 million victims around the world since its launch in 2014.

Ignatova went missing in 2018, shortly after the U.S. Justice Department indicted her on fraud and money laundering charges.

According to ICIJ’s media partner Bird, files seized by Sofia police during a search of a slain police officer’s home appear to show that Ignatova was later killed on a yacht in Greece on the order of a Bulgarian mafia boss. But some news outlets have questioned that account.

The London High Court’s decision, made public earlier this month, was part of a legal claim brought by a group of more than 400 OneCoin investors who are seeking damages to compensate them for the losses they suffered as a result of the alleged fraud, according to their lawyers at Mishcon de Reya LLP. Besides Ignatova, the order targeted seven people allegedly connected to OneCoin and two Guernsey companies used by Ignatova to buy two London properties, according to the BBC, which has reported on the scam extensively.

“This is a really important step for victims who have been seeking justice for the fraud that has been perpetrated against them,” Mishcon de Reya’s partner Rhymal Persad said in a statement published on the law firm’s website. “It has taken a long time to get to this point, but this is a significant step to ensure those allegedly responsible for carrying out these unlawful acts are properly held to account.”

ICIJ previously reported that, in 2015, Ignatova used a Dubai shell company called Oceana Properties Ltd. to buy a $2.7 million penthouse apartment on the top floor of a skyscraper overlooking Palm Jumeirah, an archipelago of artificial islands in the Persian Gulf.


The view from Ruja Ignatova’s apartment.
Like Ignatova, at least 11 of her associates owned some of Dubai’s most exclusive properties over the last nine years, the investigation revealed.

The findings were part of Dubai Unlocked, an investigation into the role of the emirate as an investment hub for criminals and suspects. The project was coordinated by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and Norwegian financial outlet E24. It was based on leaked confidential Dubai land records obtained by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization that analyzes data on transnational security matters.

According to the Dubai records, the buyers included OneCoin’s co-founder Karl Sebastian Greenwood, who is serving a 20-year sentence in the U.S. for his involvement in the OneCoin scheme; and Kari Wahlroos, a Finnish businessman who presented himself as OneCoin’s “European ambassador” at promotional events organized by the company. Greenwood declined to answer ICIJ partners’ questions. Wahlroos, who has not been charged, told Finnish broadcaster YLE that he owned several apartments in Dubai. He denied knowing that the company was used to launder money, as alleged by prosecutors. “I’ve never had a penny to do with OneCoin itself,” Wahlroos said.

Both Greenwood and Walhroos are among the subjects of the global asset freeze alongside Ignatova, the BBC reported.

It is not clear if the freezing order, which is intended to prevent the defendants from disposing of their assets, will have any immediate effect. The order may not be enforceable unless the courts in the countries where the assets are located formally acknowledge and recognize it.

Jonathan Levy, a lawyer representing other OneCoin fraud victims, told ICIJ he was skeptical about the order’s effects, considering that “nobody knows where Ignatova is.” He said that there are $2 billion worth of assets connected to the scheme yet to be “uncovered” around the world and that are unlikely to be in England, where the asset freeze would have the most impact.

In 2019, after several banks flagged transactions involving the “Cryptoqueen” and her companies as suspicious, Ignatova’s company Oceana Properties finalized the sale of her luxurious Dubai flat.

Leaked Dubai property files link luxury flats to OneCoin crypto scammers
The Dubai Unlocked investigation shows how the emirate became a refuge for self-proclaimed “Cryptoqueen” Ruja Ignatova and nearly a dozen of her associates, even as the United Arab Emirates sought to clean up its image as a haven for criminals and fraudsters.

n the spring of 2015, accused Bulgarian cryptocurrency fraudster Ruja Ignatova was amassing a fortune by selling fake digital currency.

The entrepreneur had recently founded OneCoin, a Sofia-based firm that purported to issue a cryptocurrency that she declared would be “the number one” worldwide. International investigators would later link it to a $4 billion pyramid scheme with more than 3.5 million victims around the world.

As she was getting ready to launch her business in the U.S. and potentially entice more unsuspecting investors, Ignatova and some of her associates settled in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates’ financial hub.


The FBI’s poster for Ruja Ignatova, one of their 10 most wanted fugitives. Image: U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations
There she incorporated shell companies and opened bank accounts to receive and allegedly launder money wired from OneCoin investors. She set up and managed a hair- and body-care salon called Kings & Queens with two of her OneCoin associates, documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists show. She listed as company offices two units in a building near Dubai Marina. And she used a Dubai shell company to buy a $2.7 million penthouse apartment on the top floor of a skyscraper overlooking Palm Jumeirah, an archipelago of artificial islands in the Persian Gulf, according to the documents reviewed by ICIJ.

Now newly leaked confidential Dubai land records shine a light on the role Dubai plays for criminals and suspects such as Ignatova and her cronies, many of whom are serving lengthy prison sentences or are on the run from international law enforcement. Ignatova, who called herself the “Cryptoqueen,” went missing in 2018 shortly after U.S. authorities issued a warrant for her arrest.

The Dubai records were obtained by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization that analyzes data on transnational security matters. C4ADS shared the data with ICIJ and more than 70 media outlets as part of the Dubai Unlocked investigation coordinated by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Norwegian financial outlet E24.

About the Dubai Unlocked data
The property records at the heart of Dubai Unlocked come from multiple leaks totaling more than 100 datasets, mostly from the Dubai Land Department, plus publicly owned utility companies.

The most recent dataset is dated 2022 and has information on Dubai property owners, from wealthy businesspeople and family members of prominent politicians to most-wanted criminals.

Many members of the international reporting team (but not ICIJ) previously analyzed Dubai’s 2020 land data and found that property owners included more than 100 members of Russia’s political elite, public officials or businesspeople close to the Kremlin, as well as dozens of Europeans implicated in money laundering and corruption cases.

According to the Dubai records and other corporate filings reviewed by ICIJ, in March 2015, Ignatova set up a Dubai company called Oceana Properties Ltd. and used it to buy the luxurious 5,303-square-foot flat in the Oceana Pacific building where she officially resided.

In 2017, as the U.S. Justice Department sought to indict her on fraud and money laundering charges, Ignatova closed down OneCoin’s Dubai companies and her beauty salon. Then, within days of her indictment and issuance of an arrest warrant on Oct. 12 that year, she boarded a plane to Athens and disappeared.

According to ICIJ’s media partner Bird, files seized by Sofia police during a search of a slain police officer’s home appear to show that Ignatova was later killed on a yacht in Greece on the order of a Bulgarian mafia boss. But some news outlets have questioned that account.

In 2019, after several banks flagged transactions involving the “Cryptoqueen” and her companies as suspicious, Ignatova’s company Oceana Properties finalized the sale of her luxurious Dubai flat. A title deed obtained by ICIJ’s partner Paper Trail Media shows that a young British lawyer bought the apartment for about $1.6 million. It is not clear who handled the sale on behalf of Ignatova and pocketed the money. The lawyer who bought the property did not respond to reporters’ questions.

Ignatova remains on the FBI’s list of most wanted fugitives. The agency considers her to be alive “until there is documented evidence that she is dead,” a spokesperson told ICIJ.





Oceana Pacific, the building where Ruja Ignatova owned a flat, and the views from her penthouse apartment.
Overall, the findings show how Dubai remains an attractive destination both for foreigners who want to invest in real estate in a low-tax jurisdiction and for money launderers who benefit from some local real estate agents’ “no-questions-asked” policy. Real estate investments also allow foreigners to obtain UAE residency if they buy one or more properties worth at least $545,000.

According to Jodi Vittori, a Georgetown University professor and illicit-finance expert, rules around property purchases in the UAE are more lax than those in other jurisdictions.

News investigations have repeatedly shown that property developers “were willing to take all-cash purchases; they would facilitate crypto purchases,” Vittori said. “It seemed that they were quite open to taking money from anybody and there weren’t very many rules of how to do that.”

The UAE authorities did not respond to the reporters’ specific questions but defended the country’s commitment to the fight against financial crimes. In an emailed statement to ICIJ’s British media partner, The Times, an official with the UAE’s British embassy said that the “UAE takes its role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system extremely seriously,” and that the country “works closely with international partners to disrupt and deter all forms of illicit finance.”

Clean reputation
The Dubai Unlocked revelations come as the UAE tries to clean up its image as a hub for illicit transactions. Numerous investigations and media reports have linked its banks, lax incorporation rules and free-trade zones to sanctioned individuals, corrupt politicians and gold and drug traffickers.

In 2022, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, an inter-governmental body that sets standards to combat financial crime, added the country to a list of jurisdictions under scrutiny for flaws in their anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing system. But early this year, the task force announced it had removed the UAE from the “gray list” in light of “significant progress,” including better cooperation with international anti-money laundering investigations. The task force acted at the urging of Germany, the U.S. and other Western countries despite concerns voiced by its own monitors for the UAE about the reliability of information provided by the government, according to Politico.

The fraud in Dubai is bigger than ever.

— Jonathan Levy, a lawyer representing OneCoin fraud victims

Soon after, the European Commission sought to remove the UAE from the EU’s own list of countries at high risk of money laundering, but the European Parliament blocked that proposal in April, citing “important and recent” evidence that the UAE facilitates financial crimes and the evasion of sanctions.

Unlike other notoriously secretive jurisdictions such as the British Virgin Islands, the UAE’s role as a critical military ally of the U.S. and a bulwark against terrorism in the Middle East have shielded the country from a greater degree of scrutiny by Western powers, according to some experts.

Vittori said she was “disappointed” but unsurprised that the UAE was removed from the list, owing to its political significance in the Middle East and zealous reputation-laundering efforts.

“That gives them a capability to avoid a lot of international scrutiny that a lot of other countries that weren’t so astute and didn’t have so much oil money and didn’t use it so well would be capable of,” Vittori said.

Fugitives and criminals
The review of Dubai land records by ICIJ and its media partners raises questions over the UAE’s commitment to implementing the reforms it promised to the global task force.

Like Ignatova, at least 11 of her associates owned some of Dubai’s most exclusive properties over the last nine years, the confidential data show. The buyers included OneCoin’s co-founder Karl Sebastian Greenwood, who is serving a 20-year sentence in the U.S. for his involvement in the OneCoin scheme; and Kari Wahlroos, a Finnish businessman who presented himself as OneCoin’s “European ambassador” at promotional events organized by the company. Greenwood declined to answer ICIJ partners’ questions. Wahlroos has not been charged. Asked about the properties in the leaked data, he confirmed to Finnish broadcaster YLE in a recent phone interview that he owned several apartments in Dubai. He also said he was on “really good terms” with Ignatova, but denied knowing that the company was used to launder money, as alleged by prosecutors. “I’ve never had a penny to do with OneCoin itself,” Wahlroos said.

According to Luxembourg magazine Reporter.lu and Swedish television broadcaster SVT, both ICIJ partners, Schneider sold his apartment in January 2022 while he was detained in France waiting to be extradited to the U.S. In 2023, he fled house arrest and became a fugitive.

Jonathan Levy, a London-based lawyer representing OneCoin fraud victims, says Dubai provided a haven for fraudsters and washes its hands of responsibility for their victims.

“The fraud in Dubai is bigger than ever,” said Levy. “There’s no government entity that would actually ever intervene on behalf of victims in a case like this.”

Maj. Sauod Almutawa, who works for the Dubai Police’s anti-money laundering unit, rejected any allegations that the UAE ー and Dubai in particular ー is a hub for financial crimes.

“Dubai is not a safe haven for illicit funds [and] for illicit actors,” Almutawa said in an interview with SVT.

He added that the UAE authorities are “aware” of the risk posed by criminals and illicit proceeds flowing from foreign jurisdictions to the country. That’s why they are “super confident” that their response to cooperation requests from foreign law enforcement agencies is fast and well “beyond international standards,” he said. “As an assurance to our friends and strategic partners internationally, we will even continue to improve and bolster our international cooperation,” Almutawa said.

Besides the OneCoin fraudsters, the 2022 data reveal that dozens of criminals, including mafia bosses and individuals sanctioned for financing al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, bought luxurious flats, commercial real estate and parking lots in the Persian Gulf’s financial hub. Among them are Daniel Kinahan, a former boxing promoter who is accused by Irish and U.S. authorities of running a deadly global drug cartel from the UAE, and his wife, Caoimhe Robinson.

The dataset lists passport numbers, building names, room descriptions and other details of flats and commercial properties owned by individuals and companies. ICIJ and reporters participating in the Dubai Unlocked investigation cross-referenced the property data with the UAE registry of sale transactions from 1990 to 2023.

The records also show that even individuals who are the subject of an Interpol red notice — a request for a country to provisionally arrest someone — can be property owners in Dubai. For example, Isabel dos Santos, the wealthy daughter of Angola’s former ruler, is listed as the co-owner of a two-bedroom apartment near the Dubai waterfront. Since 2019, at least three countries have frozen dos Santos’ assets. Dos Santos, who denies wrongdoing, is banned from entering the U.S. due to her alleged “involvement in significant corruption” and was recently charged in Angola with 12 crimes, including embezzlement and fraud.

As a member country of Interpol, the UAE can decide to comply with the international police agency’s request and provisionally arrest her, but it’s not obliged to.

A ‘black hole’
In recent years, the number of countries signing extradition treaties and other deals with the UAE to tackle international crimes has increased. However, the country’s financial and corporate systems continue to represent a hurdle in lawyers’ efforts to chase criminals’ assets and help their clients recover lost money.

According to the anti-corruption group Tax Justice Network, the UAE is one of the world’s “most complicit [jurisdictions] in helping individuals to hide their finances from the rule of law.”

In 2021, ICIJ’s Pandora Papers investigation found that Dubai-based financial services providers incorporated shell companies for clients who wanted to keep their identities undercover. The companies’ beneficiaries included a Belgian tycoon accused of profiting from the smuggling of “conflict gold” from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a Canadian internet mogul convicted in the U.S. of laundering money for fraudsters, child porn traffickers and other criminals.

Still today, the UAE’s legal system is a “black hole,” said Levy, the lawyer for OneCoin fraud victims. Since 2021, UAE-registered companies have been required to disclose the identity of their true owners to authorities, but only the government can access the ownership information.

In the case of OneCoin, while U.S. authorities ordered co-founder Greenwood to forfeit $300 million, Levy said that other efforts to recover victims’ money are slow-moving and that the money lost in Dubai is “as good as gone.”

Ruja Ignatova claimed to have invented a cryptocurrency, OneCoin, and took in more than $4 billion from investors around the world. But the currency was a fake and the operation a pyramid scheme, U.S. authorities say. In March 2019, the U.S. Justice Department charged Ignatova with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering. In an email obtained by prosecutors, Ignatova described her thoughts on an “exit strategy” for OneCoin. The first option: “take the money and run and blame someone else for this ...”

On March 25, 2022 in Sofia, the former head of the Criminal Police in the Second Police Precinct, Lyubomir Ivanov, was shot dead with three bullets. Documents were seized from the cash register in his home, which acquired the status of material evidence (VDS) in the murder case led by the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office. Among them are several references to agent reports. One report alleges that crypto queen Ruja Ignatova was killed in November 2018 on behalf of Christoforos Amanatidis – Taki, and another discusses Taki’s ties to the head of the General Directorate National Police /GDNP/’s Homicide Department, Mikhail Naumov, who hung an umbrella over him and his group. The Prosecutor’s Office knows about these documents, but does not consider them documents within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Code and so far does not investigate either the data on the murder of Ruzha Ignatova or the evidence of corruption of Mihail Naumov, it became clear from the response of the Deputy Prosecutor General of the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office Hristo Krastev.

BIRD was able to confirm the number of the case to which the references are attached – 8467/2022 on the inventory of the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office with supervising prosecutor Ilian Bankov. It gained popularity in the media space with the investigation of road accidents and fatal accidents. In the GDNP, the same references are found in a police case (pre-trial proceedings) 0068/25.03.2022). According to data from our sources, these references are also attached to several disciplinary cases of the Inspectorate Directorate of the Ministry of Interior. It is noteworthy that the pre-trial proceedings are conducted by an investigating policeman in the GDNP, not by an investigator, which leads to the belief that no employees of the Ministry of Interior are subject to investigation. The existence of the reports is a well-known fact for almost all employees of the management of the Ministry of Interior since their discovery in the cash register of the executed former policeman.

In this publication we look at two of these references: about the trip of the Head of the Homicide Department at the GDNP Mihail Naumov to Cuba and about Ruja Ignatova.

An informant with the initials “AI” reported that Naumov traveled to Havana for the New Year holidays 2019-20 with a colleague and both were accompanied by their husbands. The police were staying at a five-star hotel in the resort of Varadero, about 100 km away. from Havana. On the spot, they rented a fishing yacht for a few days, went out fishing and celebrated the New Year in the company of three other Bulgarians and an Italian citizen. They flew to Bulgaria on 06.01.2020, stocking up on a large amount of Cuban cigars for trade in the country.

The expensive holiday, which does not correspond to the income of the policemen, was paid by Ivan Petleshkov – close to Christoforos Amanatidis – Taki. Through Petleshkov, Mihail Naumov handed over to Taki information from the SSD and stretched an umbrella over the investigations into murders related to the crime boss. The persons with whom the police chiefs went fishing during the excursion also worked for Taki. At least that’s what the author of the report says.

The second reference is short – only one page and again is an agent report from the informant “AI”. It is about Ivan Tanev – the Universal, who was close to Taki, and Taki managed to obtain through Peevski to remove him from search.

The more important information is about how Amanatidis’ badjanak – Georgi Georgiev Vassilev, said in a drunken state that Taki ordered the murder of the crypto queen Ruzha Ignatova, which took place in November 2018 on a yacht in the Ionian Sea, more than a year after Ruja was last seen in Athens.

What kind of references are these and what follows from them?
The references are dated from 08.01.2020 and are written in a characteristic police style with numerous spelling and grammatical errors. In addition to the text, there are also photos from passports of the reported persons. Most of the events described in the reports, such as trips to Cuba, staying in an expensive hotel and renting a fishing yacht, are easily verifiable.

A BIRD reporter spoke to a source who was familiar with the preparation of these reports. They are not officially assigned within the framework of operational development of the services. According to him, the information was collected on the private initiative of former employees in the services who used their own agent sources. The information was sent to several law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Embassy.

However, it would be appropriate for the information to be checked by the services, especially since the reports become the VDS. It is logical that the presence of information with such sensitive content in the cash register of the murdered former policeman could be a motive for the crime. From the content of the documents found in the cash register of the murdered, it can be assumed that he was collecting information about the employees of the Serious Crimes Department of the GDNP. Particularly disturbing is the fact that now this department and the employees of the DNSP are entrusted with the work of solving the murder. At least there is a conflict of interest.

Beyond doubt is the great public interest in the fate of Ruja Ignatova – the most wanted woman in the world, for whom the FBI even announced a reward of $ 100,000. Therefore, any information about her alleged murder, although collected indirectly, deserves the most detailed verification. Moreover, there are already numerous judicial and media revelations about the links between Ruja Ignatova and Christoforos Amanatidis – Taki.

This also applies to the denser information about the connections of a high-ranking police chief with persons from the criminal contingent, the receipt by them of unlawful benefits and crimes in service for the benefit of Taki’s group.

So far, however, there is no evidence of either a separate proceeding for the murder of Ignatova or one against Naumov.

What do you know about the persons in the reports?
Mihail Naumov has walked the path to head of the Crimes Against the Person Sector, more commonly known as Homicide, starting with a neighborhood inspector. Before the changes, he was among the graduates of the elite sports school “Olympic Hopes”. He is engaged in wrestling and has won world and European championships for policemen. He has serious successes as an employee of the “Murders” and “Robberies” sectors in the Sofia Directorate of Interior. After the arrival of GERB, Naumov became head of the “Crimes against the Person” department in the CDNP. Under Borisov’s first government, he actively participated in the disclosure and condemnation of the “Impudent” and “The Killers”. At that time, there was professional friction with the head of “Terror” in the General Directorate for Combatting Organized Crime (GDBOP), Valentin Tsonovski. This is no exception to the tendency since the time of CSFOC anti-mafia to “fight” with the police. In 2012, there is evidence that an attack against Naumov was being prepared. Then the well-known Lyubomir Iliev – Lubo Kall was detained on charges of preparing the murders of prosecutor Oleg Yanev, the chairman of Meshereto Hristo Varbanov – the Pope and the head of the Homicide Department at the GDNP Mihail Naumov. The evidence in the case is not enough to bring the prosecution to trial. All instances acquitted the defendants.

With the beginning of the work on the “cold files” – the murders of the Transition, very to put it mildly “controversial” moments in the professional activity of the “Crimes against the Person” sector in the CDNP begin. There is no shortage of “fresh” cases.

One of the most scandalous cases on which the sector is working is the “murder”

of Peevski.” The case has become a fiasco for the Ministry of Interior and the Prosecutor’s Office. Many of the cases of the sector are based on the testimony of witnesses such as Ventsislav Damyanov –
Ventsi The Boxer
and Ivaylo
Serafimov
. Practice shows that such witnesses would say everything that the Ministry of Interior and the Prosecutor’s Office would like to be said. Very often their testimony is contradicted by the facts available in the cases. In a more thorough analysis, we will notice that the charges in the cases conducted by this team are based on the testimony of 5-6 repeating compromised witnesses. Naumov’s sector has traditionally failed in solving murders, such as that of Tatyana Stoyanova – the late secretary of the mayor of Pazardzhik Todor Popov. Sources close to the investigation say that due to negligence or any other reason, no evidence was collected that could lead to the discovery of the crime. A very specific point is that in this case there are quite reasonable suspicions of a connection between Todor Popov, close to Delyan Peevski, and the crime committed. In recent years, there have also been concerns that the Crimes against the Person sector interferes in the distribution of the drug market through the developments it leads against the participants in this “business”.

Stoycho Kubatov is one of Naumov’s trusted people. Evidence of this is his presence together with Naumov at a diploma award by the former Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov. Kubatov also acts as an expert in security forums. He is also a competitor in sambo and wrestling. Before falling into Naumov’s sector, he stood out mainly for sporting achievements in the Ministry of Interior.

Ivan Petleshkov became known because of the blackmail case against Ahmed Dogan and Delyan Peevski by one Bulgarian and two Romanian citizens. In it, Petleshkov is a secret witness of the prosecution under number 426.

Petleshkov appeared before the court on the measure of detention of Delian Georgiev and Romanian Dorin Iordache. There, he says that the defendants showed him a report of an unnamed service for cigarette smuggling and terrorist financing, which included the names of the two blackmailed – Dogan and Peevski. He was asked to convey that, for an amount of EUR 12 million, their names could be deleted.

The thesis of the indictment was developed by prosecutor Evgenia Stankova, who became famous for the “terrorist sprinklers” in front of parliament in the case “NAPLeks”. Initially, she charged terrorist financing under Article 108 of the Penal Code. Then it is obviously felt that this is a blunder, and “financing terrorism” refers rather to the repeatedly mentioned in the documents in the case Ahmed Dogan and Delyan Peevski. The prosecutor’s office also claims that it had flash drives with the report, but they were not attached to the case. After several months in custody and an agreement with the prosecutor’s office, the two detainees were released.

Ivan Petleshkov
The company “Traffic SOT”, which is related to Petleshkov, has a security contract with the Sopot Machine Building Plants – one of the largest arms enterprises in the Balkans. Petleshkov also has a pawnshop as well as a restaurant business.

According to BIRD’s operational information, what is presented in the report is very close to the actual state of affairs. Petleshkov is a trusted person of both Taki and Peevski. He has been entrusted with an important role in shopping for a vote in the upcoming elections in April.

Christoforos Amanatidis – Taki Considered in the past one of the great Bulgarian drug lords, wanted after his group was detained, but he managed to escape. He lives in Dubai. A few years later, Interpol’s search was dropped. Lawyer close to him Rashev claims that there are no travel restrictions against Taki. Amanatidis is under investigation in a case of money laundering and terrorist financing in the Seychelles, together with Konstantin Varbanov the brother of the former Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Rositsa Kirova from GERB.

Krasimir Kamenov – Curo as a successor to the structure of VIS 2 is considered a partner of Taki in the past, but according to sources from the underground their relations have cooled in recent years.

Keope Chakarian – Ami became famous as the owner of the “golden” laboratory and the “golden” parking lots of Kapitan Andreevo, key lucrative points associated with Taki’s interests.

Ivan Tanev – The Universal was charged in the case of VAT draining “The Universals” together with Mila Georgieva. This case seems to have crashed before it is brought to trial. In Romania, he and Georgieva are being sued for the theft of 26 million euros in European aid for the poor. He is believed to live in Dubai.

Georgi Georgiev Vasilev In addition to being a co-owner of the large construction company GP Group, he is married to the model Ana Shehtova, whose sister Boryana Shehtova is the wife of Christopher Amanatidis – Taki. They all live in the UAE. After the “GP Gate” scandal, pre-trial proceedings were launched against Vassilev and a multimillion-dollar sum was blocked, which he tried to transfer to Dubai. The outcome of this production is not clear.

Ruja Ignatova She is wanted by the FBI for the OneCoin scam, a cryptopyramid that has dragged customers around the world with more than $5 billion. She was last seen at Athens Airport, where she landed on a flight from Sofia on October 25, 2017 and was greeted by Russian-speaking people. At that time, she was already facing a fraud case by the prosecutor’s office in Bielefeld, Germany, and the Bulgarian prosecutor’s office knew about it. There is evidence that she was warned of an upcoming arrest warrant by a Bulgarian police officer who attended a meeting at Europol.

Testimony about the escape of Ruza to Greece given before the US court.
After the disappearance of Ignatova, part of her real estate passed into companies related to Boryana Shehtova and financier Emil Harsev. But joint asset management by Ruja’s mother Veska Ignatova and Boryana Shehtova existed before Ignatova’s disappearance, according to inquiries in the Commercial Register. There is evidence that Taki’s phone was found in the phone book of Ruja Ignatova’s brother, who was detained in the United States. In court documents in the United States, Taki’s name does not appear, but mentions a person who was the head of security of Ruja Ignatova and at the same time a powerful drug trafficker.

What do the institutions say?
We contacted the Minister of Interior Ivan Demerdzhiev for comment with the following facts and questions:

“Case 0068/25.03.2022 on the CDNP inventory contains the VDS with information about the murder of the wanted by the FBI Ruja Ignatova. According to the Air Force, an agent report, she was killed on a yacht in the Ionian Sea on behalf of Christoforos Nikos Amanatidis – Taki.

The same materials claim that the head of the Homicide Department in the GDNP, Mihail Naumov, has unregulated contacts with the person Ivan Petleshkov, who is related to Taki.

Questions:

Was a separate investigation into Ignatova’s murder initiated after analyzing this data, and if it was initiated, when did it happen? Has the prosecutor’s office been approached?

Is there an investigation into the unauthorized contacts of Mihail Naumov with Ivan Petleshkov and other persons related to Taki?”

Until the editorial end of the article, we received no response from the Minister.

BIRD also contacted former Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov, as it was during his time a year ago that the inquiries acquired the status of the UDF in the murder case of Lyubomir Ivanov. Rashkov also removed Mikhail Naumov from his post.

On the phone, Boyko Rashkov did not want to comment on whether he was aware of these reports, but stressed that Mihail Naumov had many suspicious contacts with convicted persons and was removed from office quite naturally. Rashkov also commented that after he left the ministry, many controversial appointments took place there.

Several times we tried to contact by phone the prosecutor Ilian Bankov, who is monitoring the case 8467/2022. The reception of the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office promised to give him about the call and the request for feedback, but it did not follow. Unanswered were the questions sent by e-mail to the press office of the Chief Prosecutor’s Office.

Updated: Prosecutors confirm inquiries were not evidence
After the publication by e-mail, there was a response to the questions asked to the Prosecutor’s Office, which reads as follows:

“In connection with your letter asking questions in pre-trial proceedings under p. Ip. 8467/2022, according to the inventory of the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office, we provide you with the following information.

In the course of the investigation in that file, A4 sheets of paper were included in the case, on which there is a printed text. They do not constitute a document, insofar as there is no data about their author, do not bear a signature and do not represent a specific written statement of will of a specific natural person. In this regard, they are not subject to verification by the means of proof provided for in the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), namely the appointment of a graphic expertise, whose conclusion will establish by whom the text is written and by whom the signature is laid. Also, the cited sheets of paper were seized from a place used by a person who had died and the circumstances set out in them could not be verified by the examination of a witness. For these reasons, the supervising prosecutor has come to the conclusion that the prerequisites of Art. 216 of the Criminal Procedure Code for the division of the case, as at present no evidence has been collected for a possible murder – a crime under art. 115 of the Penal Code and/or a possible crime committed in office.

Investigation is a dynamic process. In this pre-trial proceedings, new investigative actions are to be carried out. The procedural action will be carried out to divide the case if evidence of possible other crimes is collected.

Sincerely,

Hristo Krastev Deputy City Prosecutor of the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office

File 8467/2022 according to the inventory of the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office, of which the Prosecutor’s Office has officially confirmed, is hidden.

REPORT

On 27.12.2019, during a meeting with an informant, the following operational information concerning unauthorized contact between employees of the Ministry of Interior and persons from the critical contingent was received.

During the conversation, the source of information said that from a close friend he found out that the head of the Homicide Department at the GDNP – Mihail Naumov, accompanied by his employee Stoycho Kubatov, had left on a trip to the Republic of Cuba.

Naumov told his colleagues in the department that he was going to see his son, who is camping in Cuba, but did not say that he would be accompanied by Kubatov.

According to unconfirmed information, his son is a conditioning coach of a Russian volleyball team. Naumov and Kubatov left shortly before the Christmas holidays, in all likelihood, with a flight through Frankfurt. Their wives also travel with them.

On December 30, 2019, AI submitted additional information about the persons accompanying Mihail Naumov during his visit to Cuba.

On 29.12.2019 in the area of Marina “Hemingway” – Havana, Mihail Naumov was detected in the company of Stoycho Kubatov, Ivo Krastev Ivanov, Vasko Todorov Stanimirov, Italian citizen Massimo Isopi and previously unknown Bulgarian citizen named Lucien living in the US (Lucien is about 50-55 years old, thin, tall with gray hair).

Ґrupa has rented a fishing yacht for the days of December 30, December 31 and January 2.

According to AI, the yacht is owned by a Bulgarian citizen who has been residing in the Republic of Cuba for several years.

The source said Naumov’s group was also staying at a five-star hotel in the Varadero resort, about 100 km (60 miles) from Havana.

The expenses for the group’s excursion (airline tickets and hotels) were paid by the person Ivan Petleshkov (former employee of the Ministry of Interior and close to the criminal boss – Christoforos Nikos Amanatidis “Taki”. Currently, Petleshkov is the owner of the security company “Traffic Security”.

On December 30, 2019, Mihail Naumov, Stoycho Kubatov, Massimo Isopi, Ivo Ivanov and Vasko Stanimirov enter the ocean. During the cruise, Vasko Stanimirov held a conversation with the captain of the yacht about property prices in Havana, as well as possible government bans on purchases by foreigners.

AI says that upon the group’s arrival at Jose Martí Airport, Mihail Naumov handed over a certain amount in euros to the bülgarin. The money was given to him by Ivan Petleshkov, who owed it on a deal (a group of dancers from Cuba were sent to him for his restaurant).

On 31.12.2019 only Vasko Stanimirov and Ivo Ivanov go into the ocean. Mihail Naumov with his wife, Stoycho Kubatov and Lucien have visited Havana.

On 31.12.2019 against 01.01.2020 the group welcomes the New Year and the name day of Vasko Stanimirov at Marina “Hemingway”

The menu is caught by them fish.

On January 2, Vasko Stanimirov, Ivo Ivanov and Massimo Isopi go out into the ocean again. During the conversation, AI said that his friend told him that the Italian citizen works for Stanimirov, and that the whole group is part of the criminal structure of Christoforos Nikos Amanatides.

On 03.01.2019 Naumov’s group has purchased a huge amount of cigars for trade in Bulgaria. At Sofia Airport they will be welcomed by trusted employees at the border checkpoint and Customs.

REMARK:

During the time Mihail Naumov headed the Homicide Department at the CDNP, there was not a single contract murder solved. The subject of investigation became mainly opponents of “Taki”. Everything that comes as operational information from agents and from the operation of SSDs is transmitted to Amanatidis through Ivan Petleshkov. Naumov’s inner circle includes the employees of the Ministry of Interior – Stoycho Kubatov, Svetoslav Stoykov (Deputy Head of the 8th Precinct). Valentin Simeonov (Head of the 8th Precinct) as well as the former employees of the GDNP – Alexi Vasilev and Natalia Angelova. Through Ivan Petleshkov, the group is in good contact with the former Chief Secretaries of the Ministry of Interior Svetlozar Lazarov and Georgi Kostov. Through them, he maintains contact with Minister Mladen Marinov. At the moment, by order of Amanatides, Mihail Naumov exploited SSDs on the faces

Krasimir Kamenov “Karo” and Razmig Kerope Chakarian “Well”. The two were placed on Discreet control, and their names were submitted at the border checkpoint by GDNP – Mihail Naumov. Incoming information from border control

and the cameras of the Road Infrastructure Agency are reported daily to Amanatides. Basis for discreet control – threat of murder.

Upon careful review of Petleshkov’s partnerships, it is noteworthy that he is in good business and friendly contact with the famous Marin Todorov Kostov – “Marin Donkey”. The connection between Petleshkov and Naumov is a fact. This explains the disappearance of an operational development from the cash register of Naumov against Kostov and the brothers Plamen and Yordan Stoyanovi – “Dambovi” a few years ago. During the official inspection, Naumov was not investigated or punished.

On 06.01.2019 Naumov’s group took off from Havana to Bulgaria.

RELATO: Operational information acquired

On 06.01.2020, during a meeting with AI, the following operational information concerning persons from the criminal contingent was received.

The source of information says that during a conversation with an acquaintance from the General Directorate for Combatting Organized Crime (GDBOP), he learned that Ivan Tanev, “Universal”, who was reported wanted by INTERPOL, was quietly removed from search.

AI suggests that the close contact between Christoforos Nikos Amanatidis (Tanev works for Taki) and Delyan Peevski has influenced the course of the investigation. In all likelihood, the Prosecutor’s Office could not gather sufficient evidence of Tanev’s participation in a group for illegal VAT absorption and the procedural actions against him were terminated.

In continuation of the conversation, “AI” says that days before the holidays, one of the owners of “GP Group” AD – Georgi Vasilev Vasilev, PIN XXXXXXXXX (in a clearly intoxicated state) told people from his entourage that the wanted Ruzha Ignatova has been dead since November 2018. Vassilev claimed that his brother-in-law (Taki) had taken measures to make Ignatova disappear. According to the information, Amanatidis ordered the murder of Ruja Ignatova in order to erase her traces of participation in her fraudulent scheme with Onecoin. Ignatova was killed in Greece, and her corpse cut into pieces was dumped into the Ionian Sea.

Shortly before he left, Vassilev said that Taki’s main “killer” was currently in a Dutch prison. In all likelihood, it is about the person Hristo Hristov nicknamed “Koeravi”. Some time ago, Hristov was detained by the Dutch services with a huge amount of heroin.

The Bulgarian Ministry of Interior remains silent on the case.

The above for information and order! Sofia

About the Dubai Unlocked data
The property records at the heart of Dubai Unlocked come from multiple leaks totaling more than 100 datasets, mostly from the Dubai Land Department, plus publicly owned utility companies.

The new investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and more than 70 media partners, led by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, shows how one of the Middle East’s most exclusive real estate markets became a hot spot for ill-gotten wealth. The data was obtained by the U.S. nonprofit Center for Advanced Defense Studies and shared with Norwegian news outlet E24, then ICIJ and other partners.

Taken together, the leaked property records, mostly from 2020 and 2022, provide a detailed overview of hundreds of thousands of properties in Dubai and information about their ownership or usage. Economists at the EU Tax Observatory and Norway’s Centre for Tax Research who analyzed the data estimated foreign-owned residential properties in Dubai were worth $160 billion in 2022.

ICIJ and its partners used identifying information — such as names, nationalities, dates of birth and passport numbers — to confirm ownership. Reporters also obtained the deeds for some of the properties from the Dubai Land Department. A second tranche of property and transaction data from Dubai reveals additional information about the buying and selling of properties as well as rental incomes.

Dubai Unlocked is part two of a cross-border investigation into Dubai real estate purchased with illicit funds. ICIJ did not participate in part one of the project, Dubai Uncovered, published in May 2022.

Dubai Uncovered: Data Leak Exposes How Criminals, Officials, and Sanctioned Politicians Poured Money Into Dubai Real Estate
Investigation
Russian politicians under Western sanctions, financial criminals, and corrupt European officials all own real estate in the emirate, which attracts investors with liberal residency rules and a ‘few questions asked’ approach to regulation.

May 3, 2022
Spectacular skyscrapers, luxury lifestyles, and sunny beaches — these are the hallmarks of Dubai, a Middle Eastern financial hub known as a playground for the global rich.

But the glamorous emirate also has a darker reputation as a tax haven, a top destination for illicit cash, and a preferred hub for money laundering, often through real estate.

Now, a new leak of Dubai property data has exposed just how many foreigners have poured their money into apartments and villas there.

The data, which dates from 2020, was obtained by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS), a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., that researches international crime and conflict. It was then shared with Norwegian financial outlet E24, which coordinated an investigation into the real estate.

Project Partners

Reporters from over 20 publications, including many OCCRP member centers, contributed to this joint investigation. They include:

VG (Norway), Süddeutsche Zeitung (Germany), TV2 (Denmark), Knack (Belgium), iStories (Russia), SVT (Sweden), Le Monde (France), De Tijd (Belgium), Fundacja Reporterow (Poland), Atlatszo (Hungary), Investigace.cz (Czech Republic), Frontstory.pl (Poland), Direkt 36 (Hungary), MANS (Montenegro), BIRD.bg (Bulgaria), CIN (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Ostro (Slovenia), RISE Project (Romania), Eesti Päevaleht (Estonia), KRIK (Serbia), Investigative Reporting Project (Italy), Context Investigative Reporting Project (Romania), and Ostro (Croatia).

The leak provides the first detailed public overview of those who bought property in this important Middle Eastern financial center. In this initial phase of the project, reporters focused on the European names on the list.

Many of them are residents or legitimate investors. But reporters identified numerous owners of Dubai real estate who have been accused or convicted of crimes or are under international sanctions. Others are public officials whose ownership of pricey properties is difficult to square with their known incomes.

They include more than 100 members of Russia's political elite, public officials, or businesspeople close to the Kremlin, as well as dozens of Europeans implicated in money laundering and corruption. Several European officials and lawmakers who have been accused of mishandling public funds are also among the listed owners — and some have failed to officially declare their Dubai properties.

Among the noteworthy figures who own Dubai real estate are Ruslan Baisarov, a Russian businessman close to Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov, and Alexander Borodai, a sanctioned member of the Russian Duma known for becoming “prime minister” of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic during Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine.

Other Russians with Dubai properties include Roman Lyabikhov, a U.S.-sanctioned lawmaker from the Communist Party, and Dmitry Rybolovlev, a controversial oligarch.

Among the Europeans is Daniel Kinahan, the alleged leader of an Irish criminal group involved in cocaine trafficking and other crimes. He is known to be based in Dubai, and was sanctioned by the United States last month.

Another is Czech citizen Tibor Bokor, the executive director of a cryptocurrency exchange that was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury last year for enabling criminals who had obtained money through ransomware to transmit their illicit proceeds. Miroslav Výboh, a Slovak fugitive from corruption charges, is another alleged criminal who is listed as owning Dubai real estate. He is believed to be hiding out in the emirate.

Baisarov, Borodai, Bokor, and Lyabikhov did not respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Výboh confirmed his ownership of a Dubai apartment.

These individuals’ presence in Dubai’s real estate market registries highlights the danger that the emirate’s loose residency requirements and “few questions asked” approach to regulation enables questionable figures to use it as a home away from home, a place to launder their illicit gains through real estate, or simply to store their wealth.

“Real estate is unique when it comes to money laundering because, unlike any other form of money laundering, you actually can live in and do business through your money laundering,” said Jodi Vittori, a professor at Georgetown University and expert on illicit finance.

Dubai is one of the world's most secretive offshore jurisdictions, mainly due to lack of financial transparency, according to The Tax Justice Network.

The advocacy group ranks the United Arab Emirates, which includes Dubai, as one of the world’s top ten enablers of both corporate tax abuse and financial secrecy.

“Dubai has an ask-no-questions, see-no-evil approach to commercial and financial regulation, as well as foreign financial crimes,” the group wrote in a 2020 assessment. “It has consequently attracted large financial flows and some of the world’s most high-profile criminals.”

The United Arab Emirates also does not have an extradition treaty with the European Union, the United States, Germany, or many other countries. In practice, this means wanted criminal suspects can hide out in Dubai to avoid facing justice.

Representatives of the United Arab Emirates’ Foreign Office and the Dubai Land Department did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication. But the UAE Embassy in Oslo did provide a statement to E24, OCCRP, and their media partners.

“The allegations made with regard to Dubai property ownership records are factually inaccurate. The UAE operates clear regulatory frameworks that comply with international laws and standards designed to combat financial crime,” the Embassy said. “Dubai Land Department processes and activities are a cornerstone of these efforts.”


A Real-Estate Blind Spot
Dubai is a sheikhdom with internal autonomy and is part of the United Arab Emirates. But it has built its economy around being a home for expatriates.

In the 1990s, the emirate’s oil revenues plummeted and its leadership began looking abroad for investments. It found its path forward in real estate, constructing scores of new residential developments, the tallest building in the world, and two artificial peninsulas shaped like palm trees. (One was never finished due to the financial crisis of 2008, when many real estate projects ground to a halt due to credit shortages.)

Since then, real estate development has been a significant source of income for the emirate, attracting foreign capital and wealthy people from around the world. Today, Dubai has three million residents, but only half a million are Emirati nationals.

The leak of property data examined by reporters includes a total of 800,000 Dubai properties owned by 274,000 private individuals and companies from around the world. It shows that the average owner in Dubai possesses more than three properties.

“Until now, no one has had this kind of information about the whole real estate market in such a well-known tax haven,” says Annette Alstadsaeter, a professor of tax economics and director of the Skatteforsk Centre for Tax Research at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.

Alstadsaeter leads an international group of academics who have studied the leaked material and have just published a paper in conjunction with this investigation.

Based on publicly available information on property prices, the researchers estimate that foreign individuals and companies have invested over $145 billion in Dubai's housing market. In comparison, offshore-owned real estate in London, also considered a major hub for foreign property investors, was estimated to be worth $66 billion in 2019.

People and companies connected to Europe and Russia — the focus of this investigation — own more than $31 billion of this total.

Not all properties in the leak belong to individuals. A substantial portion are owned by shell companies registered in other tax havens. For this reason, the actual beneficial owners of these properties are often unknown.

“This is the first time we have an actual evident sum of net worth of both offshore and locally owned properties in a tax haven,” says Gabriel Zucman, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

Zucman is one of the world's leading experts on tax havens. He heads the EU tax observatory hosted by the Paris School of Economics and has followed the research into leaked data from Dubai.

“Until recently we could not address this kind of hidden wealth with concrete numbers, but this leak changes that. This project is a first step of shedding light on the rise of investments in real estate in tax havens as part of the broader globalization. It has not been studied much before because of the lack of data,” Zucman says.

Estimating the Value of Dubai Real Estate

The real estate values in this story are based on calculations by the researchers at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. They estimated the net worth of every real estate asset in the data leak as of the year 2020, using publicly available anonymous transaction records in Dubai and adjusting for property location and size.

Since 2020, property prices have increased significantly. The market value of the villas and apartments identified in the leak and this article is likely higher than the estimates.

Moscow on the Gulf
A noteworthy glimpse into Russian property ownership in Dubai was provided last year by the team of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

In December, his Anti-Corruption Foundation published a lengthy investigation into Alexander Borodai, a Russian lawmaker who bought a 104-square-meter apartment in the luxurious Grandeur Residences-Maurya complex on Palm Jumeirah, an elite man-made peninsula in the shape of a palm.

Borodai bought the apartment, worth over $400,000, in 2015, just as his star was rising in Russian politics.

In early 2014, he became “prime minister” of the Donetsk People’s Republic, a self-proclaimed and internationally unrecognized pro-Russian statelet in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. He held that post for roughly four months before ceding it to a Donetsk local and becoming his deputy.

He returned to Russia and, in 2021, was elected to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, as a member of the ruling United Russia party. He did not list his Dubai apartment in his mandatory asset declaration.

The data in the C4ADS leak matches the findings of Navalny’s team, confirming that Borodai — who is under U.S., EU, U.K., Swiss, Canadian, and Australian sanctions — owns the apartment.

It also includes much more: As it turns out, more than 5,300 citizens and people connected to the Russian Federation are listed as owning over 9,700 properties in Dubai, making Russians among the largest groups of foreign real estate investors there.

Though most are little-known private individuals, others are prominent politicians like Borodai, state officials, and oligarchs.

Roman Lyabikhov, another Duma lawmaker, is also listed as owning a Dubai property: a 109-square-meter apartment in the Amwaj 4 building, part of an older development in the Dubai Marina area. It is worth approximately $430,000. Like his fellow legislator, he also did not list it in his asset declaration.

He is under U.S., U.K., EU, and Canadian sanctions.

The Palm Jumeirah development.

Unlike some other oligarchs, Rybolovlev has stayed further away from Russian politics. He has reportedly lived in Europe since 2010, after he was forced to sell his majority share in the Russian mineral fertilizer producer Uralkali to three well-connected Russian businessmen.

Rybolovlev, a Cypriot citizen, is currently majority shareholder and president of the AS Monaco soccer club. In 2018, a judge in Monaco named the Russian oligarch a formal suspect in a corruption investigation, alleging that he had used gifts and football tickets to influence local law enforcement in a conflict with an art dealer.

That was not Rybolovlev’s first tangle with controversy. In 2008, he purchased a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida from Donald Trump for $95 million — netting the future U.S. president a reported $54 million in profit. That would later draw scrutiny after Trump was elected president and faced accusations that Russia had conspired to help him win the election. Rybolovlev later sold off the property.

Ruslan Baisarov.
Another prominent Russian who appears in the leak is Ruslan Baisarov, who is listed as owning five apartments in the Tiara Residences, a group of luxury high-rises on Palm Jumeirah’s trunk, and a villa on the Palm’s al Bumaan frond.

Together, the six properties are worth about $8.5 million.

Baisarov is known for his close ties to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has been implicated in grave violations of human rights, including torture, and has supplied soldiers and military resources to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year.

Baisarov has financed Kadyrov’s prestigious Veduchi ski resort outside the Chechen capital Grozny, supported the Chechen leader’s sometimes-bizzare projects, and made public appearances with him, including at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. The close relationship has earned Baisarov the nickname “Kadyrov’s wallet.”

Kadyrov is under U.S., U.K., EU, Swiss, Canadian, Australian, and Japanese sanctions.

Criminal Europe
Other Dubai property owners are figures from the international criminal scene, such as alleged cocaine trafficker Daniel Kinahan, who has reportedly found refuge in the emirate.

In the data leak, Kinahan is listed as the owner of a sizable 115-square-meter office in the exclusive Jumeirah Bay Tower 3, 15 minutes’ drive from the beach. Two companies Kinahan co-founded over the years have listed the same unit, number 3005, as their office, according to business records and a recent article in the Irish Times.

Information about Kinahan’s passport and Emirates ID in the leak suggests he acquired this property between the spring of 2017 and January 2018. At that time, his alleged involvement in drug trafficking had already been publicly known for years. A U.S. diplomatic cable sent from Sierra Leone to Belgium in 2009, and published two years later by Wikileaks, named Kinahan and described him as “an Irish businessman involved in narcotrafficking throughout Europe and currently the target of a major investigation.”

The “Kinahan Organized Crime Group” (KOCG) has operated in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain and the United Arab Emirates for years. Irish and U.K. courts have concluded that the group is involved in international drugs and firearms trafficking and in international money laundering.

“The KOCG also frequently uses Dubai as a facilitation hub for its illicit activities” and the activity has led to numerous murders, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement last month, announcing sanctions on Kinahan and other members of the group.

The announcement followed a major investigation involving multiple police agencies, and the U.S. ambassador to Ireland has announced a $5 million reward to anyone who helps arrest Kinahan or his father or brother, who are also sanctioned.

Kinahan has denied being a crime boss.

Another colorful character who appears in the data is Francesco Giordano, a Milan-based businessman who works in the meat industry.

Giordano and his romantic and business partner, Larisa Andreea Hangiu, are listed as owning three apartments together in Dubai. They’re also listed as owning one apartment each separately. Together, their properties are worth over $550,000.

Giordano’s business selling meat back home in Italy may explain these assets — but that might not be the whole story.

In 2018, Giordano was arrested by the Italian anti-mafia police along with 27 other people and charged with tax evasion.

According to investigators, he had established a complex network of companies in northern Italy through which he dodged taxes on the profits from his business. He then laundered the money to companies in Apulia, his home region, with the help of a local mafiosi.

Through a network of nominees, they withdrew cash from the bank and stashed it in various locations, including the walls of villas. His partner Hangiu was also charged after police found cash hidden in her villa outside Milan.

The police seized 27 companies, luxurious villas, and cars. No Dubai assets were found at the time. However, in 2015 Giordano was stopped by customs officers at an Italian airport while on his way to the Emirates carrying over 200,000 euros in checks and cash.

Two years later, thanks to a wiretapped conversation, the police discovered that a crooked cop had tipped Giordano off that he was under investigation for money laundering and that the police knew he was laundering his profits into restaurants in Rome and Dubai.

In February 2022, Italian prosecutors charged Giordano, Hangiu and 73 other people with 180 million euros’ worth of international tax evasion. Giordano is currently in pre-trial detention.

Neither his lawyer nor Hangiu responded to a request for comment.

Evading taxes on meat profits sounds old-fashioned. But another European with Dubai property allegedly had a much more modern criminal enterprise.

According to the leak, Tibor Bokor, a Czech venture capitalist, is listed as owning three apartments in Dubai worth $455,000.

He previously served as the executive director of a sanctioned Czech-registered cryptocurrency exchange based in Moscow. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the exchange, called SUEX OTC, last year, alleging that 40 percent of its transaction history was associated with illicit actors. It was the first case of the U.S. imposing sanctions on a cryptocurrency exchange.

The emirate is also reportedly the hideaway of a Slovak businessman wanted on corruption charges. Miroslav Výboh was a well-known lawyer and lobbyist and had even served as Monaco’s honorary consul in Slovakia.

He has been sought by Slovak police since August 2021, when two of his alleged co-conspirators in a corrupt scheme related to IT service orders for a government agency were arrested.

An Instagram photo shows the internationally wanted Výboh (right) at a Dubai restaurant with Formula One driver Charles Leclerc.
Výboh himself could not be found at the time. But a few months later, fans of Monaco Formula One driver Charles Leclerc published a photograph of Leclerc at a Dubai restaurant. Výboh, who enjoys motorsports and has driven in the Ferrari Challenge, was among the people gathered around the table.

In Dubai, Výboh is listed as owning one apartment worth nearly $2.7 million in the Alef Residences complex on Palm Jumeirah.

In an email to OCCRP, Výboh’s lawyer, Ladislav Smejkal, said that Výboh purchased the apartment in 2017, while the building was still under construction, but never planned to live in it. Construction was completed only in 2021, and the apartment is currently in a “shell and core” condition.

Due to the rise in UAE real estate prices, Výboh is currently trying to sell the apartment, Smejkal said.

Edit Eva Mikula
Romanian ex-girlfriend of Italian mobster Fabio Savi
Together with his brothers, Savi founded the White Uno Gang, a criminal organization that carried out a series of armed robberies and killings in central Italy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Arrested in 1994, his girlfriend Mikula collaborated with prosecutors and agreed to denounce the gang. Savi is currently serving a life sentence.


In Dubai, Mikula is listed as owning two apartments worth over $880,000.


Reached by reporters, Mikula declined to answer questions about her Dubai real estate, but described herself as a “successful woman” and said that her life no longer has “anything to do with White Uno.”

Ivo Rittig and Lenka Rittig
Politically-connected Czech businessman and his wife
Before the fall of Communism, Ivo Rittig was convicted for stealing money from a state grocery store, where he worked as a manager. He was sentenced to nine years in prison.


Rittig formerly had a significant influence on Czech politics. But he has been linked to many corruption scandals, including suspicious contracts with a Prague transport company. In 2021, he was cleared of all charges.


He and his wife Lenka are listed as owning three apartments in Dubai worth nearly $1.7 million. OCCRP was only able to contact the Rittigs over Instagram. They did not answer the journalist’s questions. Instead, Ivo Rittig published a post on his account mocking the questions.

Jan Kočka
Czech businessman and politician accused of tax evasion and violent crime
In May 2017, Kočka was charged with participating in a criminal group that evaded paying over $620,000 in taxes. The case is ongoing. In July 2021, he was detained on charges of extortion and violent crime.


In Dubai, Kočka and his wife Kateryina Faberova are listed as owning three apartments worth over $660,000. Kočka did not respond to a request for comment.

Marko Taylor
Estonian businessman convicted of fraud
Taylor worked for the Research Triangle Institute, a company that distributed millions of dollars of U.S. government funds for the rebuilding of Iraq.


Under a previous name, Marko Rudi, he was accused by U.S. authorities of receiving kickbacks from a Dubai subcontractor. In 2010, he reached a plea deal with the government, admitting that he had committed major fraud. After serving his 33-month prison sentence, Rudi changed his surname to Taylor and moved to Dubai.


He is listed as owning a villa and an apartment worth over $1 million in the emirate. He bought the first property in 2013. Reached by reporters, Taylor denied that he had engaged in fraud, but said he needed to make a plea deal because he had been unable to prove his innocence.

Irena Krasteva
Bulgarian media mogul and mother of sanctioned oligarch Delyan Peevski
Krasteva once owned six of Bulgaria’s largest newspapers and a major television channel. In 2015, she transferred ownership of the newspapers to her son, well-known oligarch Delyan Peevski, who sold them off in 2021.


Besides his business activities, Peevski is also a member of the Bulgarian National Assembly, a position he has held almost continuously since 2009. In 2021, he and six companies owned or controlled by him were sanctioned by the United States for his “role in public corruption,” including influence peddling and bribery.


In Dubai, his mother Krasteva is listed as owning a villa worth about $570,000. She could not be reached for comment.

Veliko Zhelev
Bulgarian businessman accused of procurement heist
Formerly the deputy chief of the Bulgarian Road Agency, Zhelev then became the most prominent businessman in the road construction industry. His company Hydrostroy has won public procurement contracts worth millions of euros. In a TV interview, Bulgaria’s interior minister accused Zhelev of involvement in a multi-million-euro public procurement heist, mentioning that $11.3 million were “transferred to the UAE.”


In Dubai, Zhelev is listed as the owner of nine apartments in the Liv Residence on the Dubai Marina and another apartment in the Serenia Residences on Palm Jumeirah. Together, these properties are worth over $4 million. Reporters reached out to Zhelev through his company Hydrostroy and also attempted to call him, but did not receive a response.

Bilyana Bobi Stoyanova
Sister of Bulgarian deputy prosecutor general with questionable family wealth
Stoyanova’s brother, Bulgarian deputy prosecutor general Borislav Sarafov, has long been suspected of possessing unexplained wealth. An investigation by OCCRP partner Bivol showed that his young son acquired two luxury flats in Sofia. Sarafov’s declared income cannot account for these purchases.


Stoyanova does not own any business in Bulgaria. In Dubai, she is listed as owning an apartment worth about $405,000. She could not be reached for comment.

Cosmin Codrin
Romanian businessman convicted of soliciting sex from underage sex trafficking victims
In 2018, Codrin received an eight-month suspended sentence and 70 days of community service for soliciting sex from high-school-aged victims of sex trafficking. The court found that the girls had been forced into the work by a criminal group including a judge, a policeman, a doctor, a lawyer, and several businessmen.


In Dubai, Codrin is listed as owning four apartments worth nearly $760,000.


Contacted by reporters, he said that he purchased the apartments using income from his companies. He also denied his guilt in the sex trafficking case. “I was included because I didn’t want to testify against people I didn’t know,” he said.

Roxana Elisabeta Sfrija
Romanian businesswoman investigated for tax evasion
Sfrija is being investigated in a tax evasion and money laundering case which focuses on the now-defunct television channel Realitatea, formerly owned by businessman Sorin Ovidiu Vantu. When Vantu faced legal trouble, the channel was transferred between several entities. Prosecutors allege that these transfers violated the law. As the investigation is ongoing, Sfrija’s exact role is unclear.


Sfrija co-owned a building in Bucharest with several people, including two former officials now in prison for corruption.


In Dubai, she and her former husband are listed as owning an apartment and a villa worth nearly $940,000.


Contacted by email, Sfrija didn’t respond. Her former husband, Cătălin Sfrija, wrote that reporters’ information was “incorrect” and that his ex-wife had provided the necessary information to authorities.

Eight years after OneCoin’s collapse, German prosecutors have filed charges against founder Ruja Ignatova.

Instead of the timely pursuit of justice (Ignatova is a German national German authorities could have done something about well before she disappeared in 2017), Bielefeld prosecutors have only now filed charges to avoid the statute of limitations.

As reported by Fakti on September 18th;

The indictment aims to prevent the statute of limitations on the alleged crimes from running out, explained the head of the prosecutor’s office, Carsten Nowak.

If the Bielefeld district court proceeds with the case, the statute of limitations will be extended by five years. By which time investigators hope Ignatova will be detained.

While not impossible, there have been no confirmed sightings of Ignatova since October 2017.

Police in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia announced that assets worth about 28 million euros were confiscated during the investigation.

German authorities opened an investigation into Ignatova’s ex-husband Bjorn Strehl in 2021.



Stehl, also a German national, was charged with money laundering offences in May 2023. Since then there have been no further update

A fugitive wanted by US authorities has been given 28 days by Guernsey's government to object to her assets being confiscated.

Ruja Ignatova, 45, known as the Missing Cryptoqueen, has until 16 December to object to a forfeiture order being brought at Guernsey's Royal Court.

Ms Ignatova has not been seen in eight years, disappearing days after an arrest warrant was issued for her in the United States.

In 2014, she founded the fraudulent OneCoin cryptocurrency, which saw investors lose more than $4bn (£3.2bn), according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

The order is being sought on behalf of German authorities in the city of Bielefeld.

A Bulgaria-born German citizen, Ms Ignatova is also wanted by prosecutors there.

With the co-operation of Guernsey authorities, Bielefeld's prosecutors are seeking to recover funds from the sale of two London properties once owned by Ms Ignatova through Guernsey shell companies.

The companies were used to buy a penthouse apartment and a smaller apartment in London.

The apartments have been subject to a Guernsey Royal Court restraint order since 4 November 2021, the day after a BBC report revealed how shell companies obscured their purchases. A restraint order aims to preserve assets so that they may later be confiscated.

Bielefeld chief prosecutor Carsten Nowak confirmed Ms Ignatova's penthouse apartment in Kensington had since been sold for £10m, and the smaller apartment for £1.4m.

However, as of May 2024 only £8.8m remained due to costs, fees and taxes. The amount may have been further reduced since, he added.

"According to German law, the money is intended to compensate OneCoin victims," Mr Nowak said.

The Guernsey legal notice seeks to "realise assets held in an account with the Royal Bank of Scotland".

The application will be heard by Guernsey's Royal Court on 13 January 2026.

Ms Ignatova is also subject to a worldwide asset freeze, brought on behalf of investors seeking compensation at London's High Court.

The search for Ms Ignatova, who is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list, has achieved global notoriety and is the subject of a popular BBC podcast and multiple TV documentaries.

A reward for information leading to her arrest was increased twenty-fold in 2024, up to $5m (£3.8m), under the US Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program.

The FBI believes Ms Ignatova travels with armed guards and may have had plastic surgery to alter her appearance.

Reports of sightings have come as recently as 2024, in South Africa.

However, that same year the BBC uncovered Ms Ignatova's ties to a suspected Bulgarian mafia boss who was in charge of her security when she disappeared and allegedly responsible for her murder.

A money-laundering trial in Germany is shining a light on the purchase of a luxury London penthouse by cryptocurrency scammer Dr Ruja Ignatova. Jamie Bartlett and Rob Byrne of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast explain how she used British-based lawyers and wealth managers - who continued to offer their services after she disappeared.

A former porter at the exclusive Abbots House apartment block in Kensington remembers meeting Dr Ruja Ignatova in 2016, as she returned from a shopping trip with her Bulgarian bodyguards.

"These two poor men came behind her like overloaded donkeys, struggling, and a bit out of breath - they must've had 20 bags each," says James (not his real name).

Dr Ruja had been splashing out on designer-label goods - Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Calvin Klein - without regard for the expense.

A little later, James got a look inside her four-bedroom penthouse flat, complete with swimming pool.

"She had an Andy Warhol painting stuffed in the cupboard, and that broke my heart because I went to art college," says the ex-policeman.

That was a print of the actress, Elizabeth Taylor. Another Warhol, Red Lenin, hung above the fireplace. To the left of a sofa in another reception room was a print of Queen Bubblegum by Michael Moebius, showing Queen Elizabeth blowing a bubble.

Private Eye later estimated the flat contained works of art worth £500,000, bought from London's Halcyon gallery.

James wondered whether Dr Ignatova was deliberately spreading her suspect wealth into assets that could be easily moved, to avoid them being seized.

Short presentational grey line
On 17 September Dr Ruja's German lawyer, Martin Breidenbach, went on trial in Münster, accused of money laundering for transferring 20 million euros to a London law firm to fund the purchase of the luxury property.

Two others are also in the dock, facing charges connected to the siphoning of millions of euros from Dr Ruja's €4bn scam - which consisted of selling something that didn't exist, a fake cryptocurrency she called OneCoin.

When the lease was signed in August 2016, financial regulators in at least one European country had already issued a warning about OneCoin. A few months earlier, Dr Ruja had pleaded guilty to fraud and other charges in a German court, after bankrupting a metal factory she'd bought and leaving 150 people jobless in 2011.

But this wasn't widely known.

Lawyers at Locke Lord, a US law firm with an office in London, did express concern about the source of the 20 million euros being transferred - this is apparent from internal emails revealed later in a US court case. But Dr Ruja's companies passed the firm's compliance checks, so they proceeded with the purchase of the property, along with Aquitaine Group, a Guernsey company offering tax haven services to wealthy clients.

Google Abbots House seen from Addison RoadGoogle

The penthouse had been refurbished by luxury property developers Candy & Candy after a fire that broke out while it was the London home of the singer, Duffy. The estate agent was Knight Frank. But quite who had bought the flat remained unclear to the outside world, thanks to British tax haven secrecy.

According to the property deed its owner is Abbots House Penthouse Limited.

This is an anonymous Guernsey shell company - one of 12,000 such companies that own properties in England and Wales - meaning that Dr Ruja's name would not have to appear on the UK deed, or in public records in the Channel Island.

Other Guernsey firms were appointed as directors (or "nominees"), and a couple of months after Dr Ruja's offer was accepted, Aquitaine was listed as the company's "resident agent" in Guernsey. The London address of Locke Lord, meanwhile, appeared on the penthouse's Land Registry documents.

This appears to have been enough to conceal Dr Ruja's purchase of the property from the City of London Police, which told swindled OneCoin investors in September 2019 that they were "unable to identify any OneCoin assets in the UK".

The truth was only revealed two months later, in emails read out in the money-laundering trial of a former Locke Lord employee in the US, Mark Scott.

Short presentational grey line
Some people in the area claim to remember their infamous ex-neighbour, but we've been told she only stayed briefly, in 2016.

That year she seemed to be preparing to put down roots in London. She opened an office at the exclusive 1 Knightsbridge building and celebrated her 36th birthday with a lavish party at the Victoria and Albert Museum. We've also heard that she was making plans for her daughter to go to a private school in the UK one day.

But mostly the 7,000 sq ft of the "ultimate penthouse", as Candy & Candy described it, remained empty. So far as we can tell, Dr Ruja didn't visit her Kensington pad at all in 2017 - and then on 25 October that year she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens, and vanished off the face of the Earth.

James, the former porter, used to visit the flat daily to ventilate it. "It was like a greenhouse up there," he said. The summer heat and direct light warped doors and faded the expensive artwork. Sometimes he would chase out pigeons that entered through a badly closing door.

Occasionally other people connected with OneCoin would come to stay. In July 2018, Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin - who took over as head of the scam a few months after her disappearance - posted a selfie taken inside the penthouse.

Konstantin Ignatov Konstantin selfie in the penthouseKonstantin Ignatov

The chaise longue, where Konstantin took the selfie above
James also remembers friends of Konstantin's visiting, and has identified Frank Schneider, Dr Ruja's head of security, as another guest who spent time there after she disappeared.

Konstantin was arrested at Los Angeles International airport on 6 March 2019 and charged with conspiracy to commit fraud. Schneider, the former head of Luxembourg's spy agency, was detained in France in April this year at the request of US authorities, and a decision on his extradition is expected this month.

James says Schneider had been trying to arrange the sale of the penthouse, but our sources tell us it was rented out instead.

Photos from a 2019 rental listing, also with Knight Frank, showed the Red Lenin still above the fireplace. There was no sign of the Liz portrait, but the eagle-eyed could spot the face of Dr Ruja herself on a special plate, gifted by one of her top promoters. We're told she hated it.

While the flat was being prepared for renting, representatives of Aquitaine came and went. One had the locks changed. A former employee of Dr Ruja's told us that another carried out sacks full of luxury possessions.

Law firm Locke Lord also continued to offer its services to Dr Ruja long after she went missing.

A letter admitted in evidence at the US trial of ex-employee Mark Scott shows that on 12 July 2018 James Channo, a partner at the London branch of the firm, wrote to Dr Ruja about her UK properties.

"We believe it is important that we revisit the manner in which you hold your real estate interests in the UK," he wrote.

The letter, addressed to Dr Ruja at a Sofia address, was sent a couple of months before Scott's 2018 arrest, nine months after Dr Ruja's sudden disappearance, and 22 months after the UK's Financial Conduct Authority revealed in a warning to potential investors that the City of London Police was investigating OneCoin. Investigations into OneCoin or affiliated companies had also been announced in a number of other countries.

Setting out the scope of the work he would like to do for £600 per hour, Mr Channo also sent email versions to Konstantin and Frank Schneider, all the while noting that email communication was "not fully secure".

The letter contained no specific details of the UK properties, but Mr Channo cautioned Dr Ruja about the need to re-evaluate her UK property holdings, "factoring issues such as tax, discretion of holding to the extent possible, and simplicity of structure".

Candy & Candy The pool, overlooking an informal reception roomCandy & Candy
The developers described it as the "ultimate penthouse" - the pool has a retractable roof
A statement provided by Locke Lord and James Channo said the letter was an offer of legal services "in a standard form", that it was disclosed by Locke Lord to US prosecutors, and that no work was done for Dr Ruja as a result.

One interesting line in the letter confirmed what our sources had been telling us - that it wasn't just the penthouse Dr Ruja had bought in the UK. On the fifth floor of Abbots House there's a less fancy two-bedroom apartment that ex-porter James told us Dr Ruja's bodyguards would stay in.

UK records show the owner of 11 Abbots House is also a Guernsey shell company, Abbots Property Limited, and that it too is registered at Aquitaine's address.

The smaller flat was also bought in 2016 - for £1.9m. Her name was again kept off the paperwork, but our sources say she was the one behind the purchase.

Asked by the BBC about its dealings with Dr Ruja, Aquitaine said it had no comment to make.

Short presentational grey line
After she disappeared, 11 Abbots House seems to have taken on a different function, serving as a secret storage facility, which our sources tell us at one point housed two large safes.

We've been told it was the immediate destination for valuables that were hurriedly cleared out of the penthouse by her staff, with the help of an Aquitaine employee, before it was rented out.

Where Dr Ruja's luxury clothes, jewellery, shoes and some of her artwork went after that remains a mystery - like nearly everything with her.

'Cryptoqueen' who allegedly defrauded victims out of $4 billion hid assets in Guernsey shell firms

One of the world's most prolific alleged scammers, who is believed to have helped defraud victims out of more than $4 billion, hid millions of pounds of assets in Guernsey shell companies.

Dr Ruja Ignatova, who rose to fame as the 'Cryptoqueen' after founding the digital currency OneCoin, is on the FBI's most wanted list - with a reward of up to $5 million offered for information leading to her arrest and conviction.

Now it has emerged that the 45-year-old, who is a Bulgaria-born German citizen, owed two London properties, including a penthouse, through shell companies in Guernsey - which were sold for a combined £11.4 million.

Carsten Nowak, a senior German Public Prosecutor who handles high-profile economic corruption cases, told ITV Channel that the funds used to buy these homes were from deposits made by some of the Cryptoqueen's alleged victims.

Mr Nowak's office has therefore applied to the Guernsey authorities to confiscate the proceeds of these sales.

His latest information suggests that, after costs and taxes, approximately £8.8 million remains in a business bank account based on the island.

His Majesty's Comptroller, Crown Advocate Hilary Pullum, applied to Guernsey's Royal Court on 24 October to enforce an overseas forfeiture order.

It essentially means that unless Dr Ruja Ignatova or anyone else objects by 16 December to her assets being confiscated, the funds are likely to be handed over to the German authorities.

The application is expected to be heard at the Royal Court on Tuesday 13 January at 10am.

If released, Mr Nowak says the money would be used to repay some of the alleged victims in Germany.

Meanwhile, the search for the elusive Cryptoqueen goes on: American investigators believe she travels with armed guards and may have had plastic surgery to alter her appearance, as she has not been seen publicly for years.

“Head Of Legal And Compliance” For Multibillion-Dollar Cryptocurrency Pyramid Scheme “OneCoin” Sentenced To Four Years In Prison
Wednesday, April 3, 2024
Share right caret
For Immediate Release
U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that IRINA DILKINSKA was sentenced to four years in prison by U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos for her role in the massive OneCoin fraud scheme.  OneCoin, which began operations in 2014 and was based in Sofia, Bulgaria, marketed and sold a fraudulent cryptocurrency by the same name through a global multi-level marketing (“MLM”) network.  As a result of misrepresentations made about OneCoin, victims invested over $4 billion in the fraudulent cryptocurrency.  DILKINSKA previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Irina Dilkinska's involvement in the sprawling OneCoin pyramid scheme was a flagrant breach of conduct.  Rather than upholding the law and embracing her position as the Head of Legal and Compliance, she facilitated and committed money laundering, aiding in the exploitation of millions of victims.  As Dilkinska learned today, this Office will hold accountable every perpetrator of the OneCoin scheme, no matter where they may hide.”

According to the allegations in the Superseding Information and other filings and statements made in court:

In 2014, RUJA IGNATOVA, a/k/a “the Cryptoqueen,” and KARL SEBASTIAN GREENWOOD co-founded OneCoin,[1] a company based in Sofia, Bulgaria, that marketed a purported cryptocurrency by the same name, which was in fact a fraudulent pyramid scheme.  OneCoin operated as a MLM network through which members received commissions for recruiting others to purchase cryptocurrency packages.  This MLM structure influenced rapid growth of the OneCoin member network.  According to OneCoin’s promotional materials, over three million people invested in fraudulent cryptocurrency packages.  OneCoin records show that between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, OneCoin generated €4.037 billion in sales revenue and earned “profits” of €2.735 billion.

DILKINSKA was the purported Head of Legal and Compliance for OneCoin.  But rather than ensuring that OneCoin complied with the law, DILKINKSA assisted in running its day-to-day operations and laundered money for OneCoin, including arranging for the transfer of $110 million in fraudulently obtained OneCoin proceeds to a Cayman Islands entity.

*                *                *

In addition to the prison term, DILKINSKA, 42, a citizen of Bulgaria, was sentenced to one month of supervised release and ordered to forfeit $111,440,000.

Mr. Williams praised the outstanding work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation. 

The case is being prosecuted by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicholas Folly, Juliana Murray, and Kevin Mead are in charge of the prosecution.

 
[1] OneCoin has operated using several corporate entities and d/b/a names, including “OneCoin Ltd.,” “OnePayments Ltd.,” “OneNetwork Services Ltd.,” “OneAcademy,” and “OneLife.”  These entities and d/b/a names are referred to collectively here as “OneCoin.”

London Lawyer Faces Prosecution Over 'Improper' Threats Linked to OneCoin Scam
Background of the Case
Claire Gill, a solicitor based in London, is currently facing legal proceedings regarding her conduct connected to the infamous OneCoin cryptocurrency scheme. Gill, who previously represented Ruja Ignatova, the founder of OneCoin, in 2017, is now accused of sending what authorities describe as "improper" legal threats to a critic, Jennifer McAdam. The threats were conveyed through YouTube videos discussing the scam and its associated fraud. political seo services

OneCoin, launched in 2014 by Ruja Ignatova while residing in Bulgaria, was a notorious Ponzi scheme masquerading as a cryptocurrency. It generated an estimated €4 billion ($4.7 billion) in revenue over two years, yet it lacked any genuine market value or underlying blockchain technology. The scheme attracted millions of investors worldwide before collapsing, leading to numerous arrests and convictions. roborock self empty dock

Details of the Allegations
The legal case centers around Gill's alleged involvement in issuing threats to Jennifer McAdam, a critic who posted YouTube videos raising concerns about OneCoin. Regulators reveal that Gill's communication was considered "improper" because she targeted McAdam when she was in a vulnerable physical and mental state. The prosecution argues that these threats, issued in the context of defamation allegations, were intended to intimidate and dissuade critics from speaking out about the scam. seo whitebridge

In her defense, Gill's legal team claims that she acted based on instructions from OneCoin representatives and maintained that there was no need to verify the factual accuracy of the claims made by clients or authorities before issuing legal threats. They contend her actions were within her professional scope and based on her instructions from the client entity, asserting that no misconduct occurred. food franchise business plan

The case is being heard at the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal in London, which has the authority to impose unlimited fines or suspend her from practicing law. The tribunal's proceedings are part of wider efforts by UK regulators to curb the misuse of legal threats to silence critics, especially in high-profile financial fraud cases. дтэк одесса график отключения

Historical Context of OneCoin and Its Impact
Ruja Ignatova, the architect of OneCoin, disappeared in 2017 amid investigations into the scheme. The scheme's reach extended across multiple jurisdictions, with Ignatova suspected of fleeing to Greece and having ties to Russia, Eastern Europe, and the United Arab Emirates. US authorities have placed her on the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, and Europol is offering a €5,000 reward for information leading to her arrest. Parimatch Casino

Prosecutors revealed that Ignatova and her co-conspirators successfully propagated the fake cryptocurrency, giving it a false market value and convincing investors of its legitimacy. Key figures such as Karl Sebastian Greenwood, a co-founder, admitted to promoting the scam as a competitor to Bitcoin, despite knowing its value was artificially inflated. Greenwood received a 20-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to charges including fraud. Hollywoodbets

Notably, Konstantin Ignatov, Ruja’s brother, was arrested in Los Angeles in 2019 and later admitted to conspiracy, fraud, and money laundering. His co-conspirator, lawyer Mark S. Scott, was also convicted of assisting in the illicit transfer of nearly $400 million from OneCoin. Scott has challenged his conviction, claiming that there was evidence of misconduct during his trial. Ninja Casino

Implications and Regulatory Response
This legal development comes amid ongoing efforts by UK authorities to strengthen rules preventing the misuse of legal tactics for silencing critics and victims of financial fraud. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy has emphasized the need for tighter regulations to prevent such intimidation tactics from harming whistleblowers and victims. Sky Bet

While Gill's case centers on her conduct, it underscores broader concerns about the accountability of legal professionals involved in complex financial fraud schemes. The case has also reignited debates about how existing laws can better safeguard individuals from harassment and threats in advocacy or investigative contexts. BitStarz

As this case unfolds, it highlights the ongoing battle against fraudulent schemes like OneCoin and the importance of robust regulation and accountability in the legal and financial sectors. The outcome could influence future regulatory measures aimed at protecting critics and victims from intimidation tactics. y-news-26799108-2026-01-13-pokerstars-sport-premieres-exciting-new-sportsbook-features-2026

OneCoin began in Bulgaria in 2014, branding itself as a cryptocurrency and telling investors that the token could be mined and had real value. In reality, it did not exist on the blockchain and was a pyramid scheme in which investors were rewarded for bringing in new participants. OneCoin is estimated to have defrauded more than $4 billion from at least 3.5 million victims.

Greenwood was OneCoin's "global master distributor and the leader of the MLM (multi-level marketing) network through which the fraudulent cryptocurrency was marketed and sold," the attorney's office said. This earned him 5% of OneCoin's monthly sales anywhere in the world.

He was arrested in Thailand in 2018 and extradited to the U.S., where he was detained awaiting trial. He pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money last December.

Co-founder of the scheme Ruja Ignatova, known as the "CryptoQueen," remains at large and was named on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Most Wanted list last year.

One of the founders behind OneCoin pleaded guilty to federal U.S. charges on Friday after one of the largest financial scams of all time, according to the Department of Justice.

The purported cryptocurrency project was fraudulent from its 2014 beginnings, prosecutors said, with OneCoin – co-founded by Karl Greenwood – setting up a pyramid scheme to market it to millions of people, generating as much as $4 billion in revenue. Greenwood, 45, who allegedly called the investors “idiots” in an internal message, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money.

“Karl Sebastian Greenwood operated one of the largest international fraud schemes ever perpetrated,” said Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. “Greenwood and his co-conspirators, including fugitive Ruja Ignatova, conned unsuspecting victims out of billions of dollars, claiming that OneCoin would be the ‘Bitcoin killer.’”

Ignatova, known as the “CryptoQueen,” remains on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Most Wanted list as another founder of OneCoin, which was based in Bulgaria. The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest.

Williams said this case and other recent actions are meant to send “a clear message that we are coming after all those who seek to exploit the cryptocurrency ecosystem through fraud, no matter how big or sophisticated you are.”

Greenwood, a citizen of Sweden and the U.K., had been arrested at his home in Thailand in 2018 and extradited to the U.S.

Press Release
Co-Founder Of Multi-Billion-Dollar Cryptocurrency Pyramid Scheme “OneCoin” Pleads Guilty

For Immediate Release
U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York
OneCoin Was a Fraudulent Cryptocurrency Marketed and Sold to Millions of Victims Around the World, Resulting in Billions of Dollars in Losses
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that KARL SEBASTIAN GREENWOOD, who co-founded OneCoin with RUJA IGNATOVA, a/k/a “the Cryptoqueen,” pled guilty today in Manhattan federal court to wire fraud and money laundering charges in connection with his participation in the massive OneCoin fraud scheme.  OneCoin, which began operations in 2014 and was based in Sofia, Bulgaria, marketed and sold a fraudulent cryptocurrency by the same name through a global multi-level-marketing (“MLM”) network.  As a result of misrepresentations that GREENWOOD, IGNATOVA, and others made about OneCoin, victims invested over four billion dollars worldwide in the fraudulent cryptocurrency.  Today, District Judge Edgardo Ramos accepted GREENWOOD’s guilty plea.  IGNATOVA, who was added to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Top Ten Most Wanted List in June 2022, remains at large.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “As a founder and leader of OneCoin, Karl Sebastian Greenwood operated one of the largest international fraud schemes ever perpetrated.  Greenwood and his co-conspirators, including fugitive Ruja Ignatova, conned unsuspecting victims out of billions of dollars, claiming that OneCoin would be the ‘Bitcoin killer.’  In fact, OneCoins were entirely worthless.  Greenwood’s lies were designed with one goal, to get everyday people all over the world to part with their hard-earned money — real money — and to line his own pockets to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.  This guilty plea by the co-founder of OneCoin caps a week at SDNY that sends a clear message that we are coming after all those who seek to exploit the cryptocurrency ecosystem through fraud, no matter how big or sophisticated you are.”

According to the allegations in the Superseding Information and other filings and statements made in court:

In 2014, GREENWOOD and IGNATOVA co-founded OneCoin,[1] a company based in Sofia, Bulgaria, that marketed a purported cryptocurrency by the same name, which was in fact a fraudulent pyramid scheme.  OneCoin operated as a MLM network through which members received commissions for recruiting others to purchase cryptocurrency packages.  This MLM structure influenced rapid growth of the OneCoin member network.  Indeed, according to OneCoin’s promotional materials, over three million people invested in fraudulent cryptocurrency packages.  OneCoin records show that, between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, OneCoin generated €4.037 billion in sales revenue and earned “profits” of €2.735 billion.

IGNATOVA served as OneCoin’s top leader until her disappearance from public view, in October 2017.  GREENWOOD was OneCoin’s “global master distributor” and the leader of the MLM network through which the fraudulent cryptocurrency was marketed and sold.  In a video posted online, IGNATOVA attributed to GREENWOOD the idea of marketing and selling OneCoin through an MLM network structure.  GREENWOOD earned approximately €20 million a month in his role as the top MLM distributor of OneCoin.

GREENWOOD and IGNATOVA conceived of and built the OneCoin business fully intending to use it to defraud investors.  For example, in the summer of 2014, when GREENWOOD and IGNATOVA were developing the concept for OneCoin, they referred to the cryptocurrency in email correspondence as “trashy coin.”  On June 11, 2014, IGNATOVA wrote to GREENWOOD concerning the OneCoin business plan, stating in part:

It might not be [something] really clean or that I normally work on or even can be proud of (except with you in private when we make the money) – but . . . I am especially good in this very borderline cases [sic], where the things become gray - and you as the magic sales machine - and me as someone who really can work with numbers, legal and back you up in a good and professional way - we could really make it big - like MLM meets bitch of wall street ;-)

In an August 9, 2014, email between GREENWOOD and IGNATOVA, IGNATOVA described her thoughts on the “exit strategy” for OneCoin.  The first option that IGNATOVA listed was, “Take the money and run and blame someone else for this . . . .”  And in a September 11, 2016, exchange with IGNATOVA’s brother, Konstantin Ignatov, GREENWOOD referred to OneCoin investors stating, “These ppl are idiots,” to which Ignatov responded, “as you told me, the network would not work with intelligent people ;)”

As a result of misrepresentations made by GREENWOOD, IGNATOVA, and other OneCoin representatives, victims throughout the world wired investment funds to OneCoin-controlled bank accounts in order to purchase OneCoin packages.  OneCoin falsely claimed that the value of OneCoin was based on market supply and demand, when in fact, the value of the cryptocurrency was simply set by OneCoin itself.  For example, on June 9, 2014, in an email sent by IGNATOVA to a representative of a blockchain development company, copying GREENWOOD, IGNATOVA stated, “we are building our own cryptocurrency - and would like to set up an internal exchange service for them.  We would like to be able to set the price manually and automatically and also control the traded volume.”  On March 21, 2015, IGNATOVA wrote an email to GREENWOOD, in which IGNATOVA stated, “We can manipulate the exchange by simulating some volatility and intraday pricing.”  (bold in original).  And in an August 1, 2015, email, IGNATOVA wrote to GREENWOOD, and included as part of a section of the email entitled “Goals”: “6. Trading coin, stable exchange, always close on a high price end of day open day with high price, build confidence - better manipulation so they are happy.”  The purported value of a OneCoin grew steadily from €0.50 to approximately €29.95 per coin.  The purported price of OneCoins never decreased in value.

GREENWOOD and other OneCoin leaders also claimed that the OneCoin cryptocurrency was “mined” using mining servers maintained and operated by the company.  In fact, OneCoins were never mined using computer resources.  For example, in an email to IGNATOVA dated August 11, 2014, GREENWOOD proposed, “Get members to think that they are mining their OneCoin via crunching (exchanging) tokens for OneCoin.  This storey [sic] is good as ppl will then not go super crazy and just try and sell tokens all the time.”  GREENWOOD emailed IGNATOVA the following day, writing, “The concept of converting tokens into OneCoin is an important phase for validity and truth behind the OneCoin.  The so called ‘mining’ of coins is a concept that is very familiar in the industry and a story we can sell to the members.”  IGNATOVA then wrote to GREENWOOD, “We are not mining actually - but telling people shit,” to which GREENWOOD responded, “how can this be investigated and found out?” and “Can any member (trying to be clever) find out that we actually are not investing in machines to mine but it is merely a piece of software doing this for us?”

GREENWOOD and other OneCoin leaders further claimed that OneCoin maintained a private “blockchain,” or a digital ledger identifying OneCoins and recording historical transactions.  But OneCoin lacked a true blockchain, that is, a public and verifiable blockchain. Indeed, by approximately March 2015, IGNATOVA and GREENWOOD had started allocating to OneCoin members coins that did not even exist in OneCoin’s purported private blockchain, referring to those coins as “fake coins.”

GREENWOOD and IGNATOVA promoted OneCoin, including at official OneCoin events all over the globe.  One such event, called “Coin Rush,” was held at Wembley Arena in London on June 11, 2016.  Thousands of OneCoin members attended Coin Rush.  During the event, GREENWOOD introduced IGNATOVA to the crowd, stating in part: “This is the creator, the mastermind, the founder of cryptocurrency, of OneCoin . . . Now, this will be the biggest welcoming on stage that we’ve ever done in history.”  Then, to the tune of Alicia Keys’s “Girl on Fire,” and surrounded by actual onstage fireworks, IGNATOVA strode onto the Wembley Arena stage wearing a red ball gown.  She proceeded to repeatedly and favorably compare her fraudulent cryptocurrency to Bitcoin, stating, among other things, “OneCoin . . . is supposed to be the Bitcoin killer” and “In two years, nobody will speak about Bitcoin anymore.”

On July 4, 2015, a federal holiday commemorating the independence of the United States, IGNATOVA announced the official opening of the United States market for OneCoin.  In early July 2015, GREENWOOD sent IGNATOVA an email stating in part, “I thought this could go out tonight, problem is I don’t have the access to send out to the members,” and attaching a document which announced a July 4, 2015, online webinar hosted by IGNATOVA and others to mark the official opening of the United States market for OneCoin.  Thereafter, on July 4, 2015, IGNATOVA participated in an online webinar, later posted to YouTube.com, in which IGNATOVA announced the official opening of the United States market for OneCoin.  During the webinar, IGNATOVA said, among other things, “[I]f we want to go and catch Bitcoin, we never can do this without being strong in the U.S. and without being part of the community.  So, um, this is actually why I am so excited about the U.S. as the market.  It’s something that is about prestige.  It’s a huge market.  And, um, it is, I think, a place of innovation, of Wall Street, a place where we have to be if we want to be big.”  Many victims in the United States invested in fraudulent OneCoin cryptocurrency packages, including residents of the Southern District of New York.

GREENWOOD was arrested at his residence on the island of Koh Samui, Thailand, in July 2018, and was extradited to the United States to face fraud and money laundering charges in October 2018.  GREENWOOD has been detained since his arrest in July 2018.

On October 12, 2017, IGNATOVA was charged with OneCoin-related fraud and money laundering charges in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and a federal warrant was issued for her arrest.  On October 25, 2017, IGNATOVA traveled on a commercial flight from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Athens, Greece, and has not been seen publicly since.  IGNATOVA was added to the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted List in June 2022.  The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to IGNATOVA’s arrest.

*                *                *

GREENWOOD, 45, a citizen of Sweden and the United Kingdom, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison, one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison. 

The maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by a judge.  Sentencing before Judge Ramos is scheduled for April 5, 2023.

Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which jointly conducted this investigation with Special Agents from the U.S. Attorney’s Office.  Mr. Williams also thanked the Royal Thai Police for their assistance in the arrest of GREENWOOD.

If you have any information about IGNATOVA’s whereabouts, please contact your local FBI office or the nearest American Embassy or Consulate.  Tips can be reported anonymously and can also be reported online at tips.fbi.gov.

The case is being prosecuted by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher J. DiMase, Nicholas Folly, Juliana N. Murray, and Kevin Mead, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Julieta V. Lozano of the New York County District Attorney’s Office, are in charge of the prosecution.

Bulgarian national Irina Dilkinska, the former head of legal and compliance for OneCoin, was sentenced to 4 years in prison for money laundering and wire fraud.
Dilkinska helped executives launder hundreds of millions in fraud proceeds.
She is the latest OneCoin executive to be brought to justice for her role in the $4 billion crypto Ponzi scheme.
OneCoin’s former head of legal and compliance was sentenced to four years in prison on Wednesday for her role in the infamous $4 billion crypto ponzi scheme.

Instead of ensuring OneCoin was operating within legal and regulatory parameters, prosecutors say Bulgarian national Irina Dilkinska helped with the day-to-day operations of the scheme and, after its collapse in 2016, helped executives launder their ill-gotten gains by working with American lawyer Mark Scott to squirrel away $400 million to the Cayman Islands.

Scott, a former partner at international law firm Locke Lord, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the scheme earlier this year.

Dilkinska, 42, was extradited to the U.S. in March 2023 and charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. She pleaded guilty to both charges in November 2023. New York District Court Judge Edgardo Ramos also ordered Dilkinska to forfeit $111.4 million.

Dilkinska is the latest OneCoin executive to be put behind bars for her involvement in the scam, which started in Bulgaria in 2014 and shut down in early 2017.

OneCoin’s co-founders, Bulgarian national Ruja Ignatova and joint U.K. and Swedish citizen Karl Greenwood, promoted the fictitious cryptocurrency – which never existed on any blockchain – through a kind of multi-level marketing scheme, paying initial investors to bring in more investors. By the time OneCoin was revealed to be a scam, an estimated 3.5 million people had fallen victim.

Greenwood was sentenced to 20 years in prison in September 2023 and ordered to forfeit $300 million.

So-called “Cryptoqueen” Ignatova remains at large, seven years after vanishing in Athens in 2017. In 2022, Ignatova was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted List, offering a $250,000 bounty for information leading to her arrest.

Whether Ignatova will ever be brought to justice remains unclear. The FBI has suggested she could have altered her appearance with plastic surgery or may be traveling on a German passport in the Middle East or Eastern Europe.

There are also rumors that Ignatova may be dead. In 2023, a report from a Bulgarian media organization suggested that Ignatova was murdered and subsequently dismembered on a yacht in the Ionian Sea in 2018 at the command of a Bulgarian drug lord known as “Taki.”

Press Release
Former Law Firm Partner Sentenced To 10 Years In Prison For Laundering $400 Million Of OneCoin Fraud Proceeds
Thursday, January 25, 2024
Share right caret
For Immediate Release
U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that MARK SCOTT was sentenced to 10 years in prison by U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos for laundering approximately $400 million of proceeds from the massive international fraud scheme known as “OneCoin.”  Today’s sentencing followed SCOTT’s conviction on all counts at trial on November 21, 2019.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Mark Scott, previously convicted at trial of laundering over $400 million of OneCoin proceeds for ‘Crypto Queen,’ Ruja Ignatova, used his law license as a means to participate in a massive money laundering scheme for a cryptocurrency that had no value since its inception.  Scott, an equity partner at a prominent international law firm, had boasted of earning ‘50 by 50.’  Indeed, Scott accomplished his goal, but by fraud and deception, and will now spend a decade in prison and has been ordered to forfeit all of his illegal proceeds.”

According to the Indictment, documents filed in the case, and evidence introduced at trial:

OneCoin, which began operations in 2014 and was based in Sofia, Bulgaria, marketed and sold a fraudulent cryptocurrency by the same name through a global multi-level-marketing (“MLM”) network.  OneCoin began operating in the U.S. in or around 2015.  The OneCoin scheme was one of the largest fraud schemes ever perpetrated.  Between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, the scheme took in more than $4 billion from at least 3.5 million victims. 

OneCoin marketed its fake cryptocurrency through a global MLM network of OneCoin members.  Unlike legitimate cryptocurrencies, OneCoin had no actual value and was conceived of as a fraud from day one.  The misrepresentations made to OneCoin investors were legion, and the cryptocurrency was worthless.  Among other things, OneCoin lied to its members about how its cryptocurrency was valued, claiming that the price of OneCoin was based on market supply and demand, when in fact OneCoin itself arbitrarily set the value of the coin without regard to market forces.  The purported value of a OneCoin grew steadily from €0.50 to approximately €29.95 per coin, as of in or about January 2019.  The purported price of OneCoins never decreased in value.

SCOTT, who was employed between June 2015 and September 2016 as an equity partner at Locke Lord LLP, a prominent international law firm, was first introduced to OneCoin’s co-founder, RUJA IGNATOVA, in September 2015.  Beginning in early 2016, SCOTT formed a series of fake private equity investment funds in the British Virgin Islands known as the “Fenero Funds.”  SCOTT then disguised incoming transfers of approximately $400 million into the Fenero Funds as investments from “wealthy European families,” when in fact the money represented proceeds of the OneCoin fraud scheme.  SCOTT layered the money through various Fenero Fund bank accounts in the Cayman Islands and the Republic of Ireland.  SCOTT subsequently transferred the funds back to IGNATOVA and other OneCoin associated entities, this time disguising the transfers as outbound investments from the Fenero Funds.  As part of the scheme, SCOTT and his co-conspirators lied to banks and other financial institutions all over the world, including to banks in the U.S., to cause those institutions to make transfers of OneCoin proceeds and evade anti-money laundering procedures.

SCOTT, who boasted about earning “50 by 50,” was paid more than $50 million for his money laundering services.  He used that money to purchase, among other things, a collection of luxury watches worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, a Ferrari and several Porsches, a 57-foot Sunseeker yacht, and three multimillion-dollar seaside homes in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

*                *                *

In addition to the prison term, SCOTT, 55, of Coral Gables, Florida, was sentenced to three years of supervised release.  SCOTT was also ordered to forfeit a money judgment in the amount of $392,940,000, several bank accounts, a yacht, two Porsche automobiles, and four real-estate properties.

Mr. Williams praised the outstanding work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation. 

The case is being prosecuted by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicholas Folly, Juliana Murray, and Kevin Mead are in charge of the prosecution.

Bulgarian Woman Charged For Role In Multi-Billion-Dollar Cryptocurrency Pyramid Scheme “OneCoin” And Extradited From Bulgaria To The United States

For Immediate Release
U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York
Dilkinska was Head of Legal and Compliance for Fraudulent Cryptocurrency Marketed and Sold to Millions of Victims Around the World, Resulting in Billions of Dollars in Losses
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Michael J. Driscoll, the Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and Thomas Fattorusso, Special Agent in Charge of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation, New York Field Office (“IRS-CI”), announced today the unsealing of charges against IRINA DILKINSKA in connection with her participation in the massive OneCoin fraud scheme.  OneCoin, which began operations in 2014 and was based in Sofia, Bulgaria, marketed and sold a fraudulent cryptocurrency by the same name through a global multi-level-marketing (“MLM”) network.  As a result of misrepresentations made about OneCoin, victims invested over $4 billion worldwide in the fraudulent cryptocurrency.  DILKINSKA was extradited from Bulgaria yesterday and will be presented before United States Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn later today.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Irina Dilkinska, the supposed Head of Legal and Compliance for the OneCoin cryptocurrency pyramid scheme, accomplished the exact opposite of her job title and allegedly enabled OneCoin to launder millions of dollars of illegal proceeds through shell companies.  Dilkinska helped perpetuate a wide-ranging scheme with millions of victims and billions of dollars in losses, and she will now face justice for her alleged crimes.”

FBI Assistant Director Michael J. Driscoll said: “As alleged in the charges unsealed today, Dilkinska helped her co-conspirator, Mark Scott, launder approximately $400 million in OneCoin proceeds while she was purportedly OneCoin’s Head of Legal and Compliance.  Further, when she learned of Scott’s arrest, she destroyed incriminating documents and sent another co-conspirator incriminating messages.  As the actions announced today should demonstrate, the FBI will continue its determination to bring alleged fraudsters like Dilkinska to justice.”

IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso said: “The charges against Irina Dilkinska are the outcome of the exceptional investigative work of our federal and international law enforcement partners.  Those who commit fraud are put on notice today that IRS Criminal Investigation is committed to holding them accountable no matter where they are located.”

According to the allegations in the Superseding Indictment and other filings and statements made in court:[1]

In 2014, RUJA IGNATOVA, a/k/a “the Cryptoqueen,” and KARL SEBASTIAN GREENWOOD co-founded OneCoin,[2] a company based in Sofia, Bulgaria, that marketed a purported cryptocurrency by the same name, which was in fact a fraudulent pyramid scheme.  OneCoin operated as a MLM network through which members received commissions for recruiting others to purchase cryptocurrency packages.  This MLM structure influenced rapid growth of the OneCoin member network.  Indeed, according to OneCoin’s promotional materials, over three million people invested in fraudulent cryptocurrency packages.  OneCoin records show that, between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, OneCoin generated €4.037 billion in sales revenue and earned “profits” of €2.735 billion.

DILKINSKA was the purported Head of Legal and Compliance for OneCoin, but rather than ensuring that OneCoin complied with the law, DILKINKSA assisted in the creation and management of shell companies in order to launder OneCoin proceeds and to hold property belonging to IGNATOVA.  For example, in 2016 and 2017, DILKINSKA helped co-conspirator MARK SCOTT, a former equity partner at a prominent international law firm, launder approximately $400 million in OneCoin proceeds through a series of fake Cayman Islands investment funds operated by SCOTT.  Among other things, DILKINSKA used a company named B&N Consult EEOD, which was falsely described as offering “proprietary consulting services, support and software solutions” to its clients and as generating €200 million in 2015 through 2016, to disguise the transfer of millions of dollars as purported “investments” into SCOTT’s funds.  In reality, B&N was a shell company that did not generate legitimate income and was used by DILKINSKA to launder OneCoin proceeds.  In or around September 2018, DILKINSKA learned of SCOTT’s arrest in connection with his laundering of OneCoin proceeds.  Shortly thereafter, DILKINSKA burned incriminating documents, sent co-conspirator KONSTANTIN IGNATOV a text message with a link to a newspaper article about the arrest, and then wrote a series of texts, including, “See this!!!!!”; “Something is going on!!!!!”; and “If this is true I need the mega lawyers for whom [co-conspirator FRANK SCHNEIDER] was talking!!!”

On October 12, 2017, IGNATOVA was charged with OneCoin-related fraud and money laundering charges in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and a federal warrant was issued for her arrest.  On October 25, 2017, IGNATOVA traveled on a commercial flight from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Athens, Greece, and has not been seen publicly since.  IGNATOVA was added to the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted List in June 2022.  The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to IGNATOVA’s arrest.

*                *                *

DILKINKSA, 41, of Sofia, Bulgaria, has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison.

The maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by a judge.

Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the IRS-CI and the FBI, which jointly conducted this investigation with Special Agents from the U.S. Attorney’s Office.  Mr. Williams also thanked the United States Marshals Service, the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs, and Bulgarian authorities.

If you have any information about IGNATOVA’s whereabouts, please contact your local FBI office or the nearest American Embassy or Consulate.  Tips can be reported anonymously and can also be reported online at tips.fbi.gov.

The case is being prosecuted by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher J. DiMase, Nicholas Folly, Juliana N. Murray, and Kevin Mead are in charge of the prosecution.

The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

[1] As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment and the descriptions of the Indictment set forth below constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.

[2] OneCoin has operated using several corporate entities and d/b/a names, including “OneCoin Ltd.,” “OnePayments Ltd.,” “OneNetwork Services Ltd.,” “OneAcademy,” and “OneLife.”  These entities and d/b/a names are referred to collectively here as “OneCoin.”

this is Ruja Ignatova

Wikipedia will tell you she's a Bulgarian-German entrepreneur, but in reality she's the biggest scammer you've (probably) never heard of

recently inducted into the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted, there's a $5m bounty on her head (give it to ZachXBT already)

unlike many crypto founders, the 'Crypto Queen' has some impressive credentials:

> awarded a scholarship to the University of Konstanz
> graduated with a PhD in private international law
> completed a Masters at the University of Oxford
> went on to work with ex-McKinsey

unfortunately she left all that hard work behind and went full Solana trencher mode, launching the "BitCoin Killer" OneCoin in 2014:

> raised 4 billion dollars
> convinced Ugandan farmers to trade goats for coins
> sadly, Somalia shunned her WP for day care grants
> filled Wembley Arena for a 2016 OneCoin event
> like all good grifters she had a yacht ("The Davina")

however:

> there was no blockchain 
> just a guy typing fake numbers into a spreadsheet

i'll say that again:

Ruja Ignatova raised $4 billion and built NOTHING

scams like this always come to an end, and this one collapsed in October 2017

> Ruja was due on stage in Lisbon
> instead, she flew Ryan Air to Athens
> she was never seen again

or was she? 

> potentially living between Dubai and Frankfurt
> rumoured to have undergone extensive surgery
> maybe assisted by the Bulgarian mafia
> some say "Taki" (big big boss) is personally helping

a private investigator claims to have spotted Ruja enjoying fine dining in Athens as recently as 2023, but that conflicts with another timeline:
 
> Ruja was found dead on a yacht on the Ionian Sea
> murdered, dismembered and thrown overboard 
> Hristo Hristov, a Bulgarian, is "responsible"
> he's currently in a Dutch prison for drug smuggling

my own theory is this:

> the OneCoin scam came from the Bulgarian mafia
> Ruja Ignatova was the face, Taki bankrolled her
> Hristo is the fall guy

which leaves only two questions:

Cryptoqueen' brother admits role in OneCoin fraud

Konstantin Ignatov has pleaded guilty
Konstantin Ignatov, the brother of "missing cryptoqueen" Dr Ruja Ignatova, has admitted his role in the OneCoin crypto-currency fraud.

Ignatov pleaded guilty to several charges, including money laundering and fraud.

OneCoin and the disappearance of its co-founder, Dr Ruja Ignatova, have been the subject of a BBC Sounds podcast.

Investigators believe as much as £4bn was raised globally in what is said to have amounted to a Ponzi scheme.

The Bulgaria-based organisation behind OneCoin Ltd continues to operate and denies all wrongdoing.

Ignatov was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in March.

He signed a plea deal document on 4 October - but it was made public, on 12 November, only after being obtained by Inner City Press journalist Matthew Russell Lee.

By complying with the terms of the plea deal, Ignatov will not face further criminal charges for his role in OneCoin, other than any criminal tax violations that may emerge.

OneCoin/YouTube Dr Ruja IgnatovaOneCoin/YouTube
Dr Ruja Ignatova is still missing
The document says Ignatov's cooperation with the authorities may "reveal activities of individuals who might use violence" against him or his family.

It suggests he could apply to the US witness protection scheme and be assigned a new identity.

He has not yet been sentenced but faces up to 90 years in prison for his role in the fraud.

Disappearance clues
Ignatov has also been testifying in the trial of a US lawyer accused of laundering some of the proceeds from OneCoin.

Mark Scott is accused of routing approximately $400m (£310m) out of the US while trying to conceal the true ownership and source of the funds.

He faces one charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering and another to commit bank fraud. He has pleaded not guilty.

During that trial, Ignatov has revealed more details about the disappearance of his sister Dr Ruja Ignatova.

According to his testimony, Dr Ignatova was living in Sofia, Bulgaria before she vanished, the Inner City Press reports.

He confirmed that Dr Ignatova had told him critics of OneCoin were "haters", and that she was "very tired".

She was afraid somebody close to her was going to give her up to the the FBI, he said.

He claims she told him she had got hold of a "big passport" and asked him to get her plane tickets to Vienna, Austria and then Athens, Greece.

Ignatov said he had not spoken to his sister since she had disappeared. He had hired a private investigator to find her but had been unsuccessful.

The US government has said it expects Mr Scott's trial to conclude next week.

Analysis
By Jamie Bartlett, The Missing Cryptoqueen presenter
Ignatov's plea deal will come as a great relief to OneCoin's critics.

Those who were threatened with legal action for calling OneCoin a scam will now feel vindicated.

Even though I have spent so long investigating this case, I was surprised to see the brother turn so dramatically against his sister.

Ignatov seems to be implying even he was duped by her.

There is nothing definitive about her whereabouts yet - but there are certainly some new leads to follow.

The case will slow down the continuing promotion of OneCoin - but it might not stop it entirely.

In the past, OneCoin promoters have dismissed all criticism and evidence as being politically motivated or coming from "haters". They may do that again.

I believe the head office in Sofia remains open for business and I have already seen some supporters say they will continue to promote.

For lower-level investors this might be a difficult time - as they will have to admit they have been duped and their money is gone.

That won't be easy.

Details of Konstantin Ignatov’s OneCoin guilty plea
Nov.15, 2019 in OneCoin, regulation
Courtesy of Matthew Russell Lee from the Inner City Press, details of Konstantin Ignatov’s guilty plea have been made public.

That Ignatov was cooperating with the DOJ was revealed during the early days of Mark Scott’s criminal trial.

It was assumed Ignatov had also reached a plea agreement, but details weren’t publicly available.

Reporter Matthew Russell Lee managed to get a copy of Ignatov’s plea agreement and made it public.

As per Ignatov’s plea agreement, the four charges leveled against him total a potential ninety years imprisonment.

The agreement sees Ignatov admit forfeiture allegations in all four counts.

This will see Konstantin

forfeit to the United States … any and all property … the constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to (OneCoin related) offenses.

With respect to cooperation with the DOJ, Ignatov is required to

truthfully and completely disclose all information with respect to the activities of himself and others concerning all matter about which this Office (DOJ), the FBI, the IRS, and any other law enforcement agency requires of him.

The scope of Ignatov’s cooperation extends to attending any requested meetings, producing documents any other tangible evidence requested.

Ignatov’s testimony at Mark Scott’s trial is also part of the plea agreement.

The defendant … shall truthfully testify before the grand jury and at any trial and other curt proceeding with respect to any matters about which this Office may request his testimony.

Again underscoring OneCoin’s ties to organized crime, the plea agreement also makes reference to retaliatory violence.

It is understood that Ignatov’s truthful cooperation with this Office is likely to reveal activities of individuals who might use violence, force, and intimidation against Ignatov, his family, and loved ones.

Should Ignatov’s cooperation present a significant risk of physical harm, this Office, upon the written request of Ignatov, will take steps that it determines to be reasonable and necessary to attempt to ensure his safety and that of his family and loved ones.

It was disclosed in Ignatov’s release filings that he has a pregnant girlfriend. Presumably “family” above does not extend to Ignatov’s parents or his sister, Ruja.

“Steps” to ensure protection of Ignatov and his family include witness protection,

whereby Ignatov, his family, and loved ones, if approved, could be relocated under a new identity.

Who specifically might cause harm to Ignatov and his family is not disclosed.

Ignatov’s plea agreement was signed by himself and his attorney on October 4th.

Konstantin testifies for DOJ, turns on OneCoin and sister
Nov.06, 2019 in OneCoin, regulation
Konstantin Ignatov has appeared as a witness for the DOJ.

Examination by prosecutors spanned questions about his involvement in OneCoin, working under his sister, Ruja Ignatova, and Mark Scott’s visit to the Sofia head office.

Konstantin (right) appeared for the DOJ as a cooperating witness in prison blues.

Ignatov is currently being held at the Metropolitan Correction Center, pending his own criminal trial.

Our source for information inside Mark Scott’s trial is Matthew Russel Lee, reporting for the Inner City Press.

According to Lee’s report Konstantin

described OneCoin as a multi level marketing operation and identified the Sophia headquarters where Mark Scott visited.

We don’t have a transcript of the DOJ’s entire line of questioning. What we do know however is questioning of Ignatov by the DOJ wrapped up today.

Tomorrow Scott’s defense team will have access to Ignatov for cross-examination.

According to Lee, Scott’s attorney intends to establish Ignatov himself was unaware OneCoin didn’t have a blockchain.

The implication being if Ruja Ignatova’s brother and acting OneCoin CEO didn’t know, how was Mark Scott to know.

I believe this ties into intent. Mark Scott’s defense appears to be “OK I might of lied to banks, but I wasn’t doing it to launder money for OneCoin because I knew it was a fraudulent company”.

Konstantin Ignatov is facing a lengthy prison sentence if convicted. His appearance for the DOJ practically confirms a plea deal in his own case.

Unfortunately we’re likely to be waiting some time before the details of that agreement are made public.

We’re also keeping an eye out for Sebastian Greenwood.

Once again, our thanks to Matthew Russel Lee of the Inner City Press for his coverage.

US Govt pushes for time-served sentence for OneCoin leader Konstantin Ignatov
 Maria Nikolova 0 Comments February 27, 2024


The United States Government has submitted a letter requesting a sentence of time-served for the leader of OneCoin, Konstantin Ignatov.

The letter was filed with the New York Southern District Court on February 26, 2024.

The Government notes that the defendant committed serious crimes and lied on the witness stand when he testified at the trial of United States v. Mark Scott as a cooperating witness for the Government. However, considering all of the Section 3553(a) factors, and because the defendant has already served almost three years in prison prior to sentencing, the Government agrees with the recommendation of the Probation Department and the request of the defendant that a sentence of time-served is appropriate.

Ignatov is the younger brother of Ruja, OneCoin’s co-founder and top leader until her disappearance from public view, in or about October 2017. In or around June 2016, Ignatov began working for OneCoin as Ruja’s personal assistant. In that role, Ignatov was responsible for coordinating travel and meetings for Ruja. Ignatov was unaware that OneCoin was a fraudulent scheme when he began working at OneCoin.

Beginning in or about October 2017, after Ruja disappeared, Ignatov quickly rose to the level of a high-level executive and spokesperson for OneCoin. Although Ignatov did not have an official title, he ultimately became the de facto leader for OneCoin, primarily because he was the sibling of Ruja. Ignatov also appeared at promotional events in Thailand, Singapore, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Bulgaria, France, and Spain. As a leader of OneCoin, Ignatov made fraudulent representations to investors about OneCoin’s structure, value, usability, and future public offering.

Despite gaining a deeper understanding of the OneCoin fraud scheme, Ignatov continued to keep the scheme going. In order to keep the OneCoin fraud scheme going, Ignatov made numerous misrepresentations to the public, including that OneCoin had a blockchain that it was “easy to use, easy to mine;” that Ignatov was in regular communication with Ruja; and that a purported merchant platform called Dealshaker was up and running with 50,000 merchants. These representations, among others, were false, and were intended to calm investors down after Ruja’s disappearance, and to get them to further invest in OneCoin.

Ignatov began proffering with the Government on or about July 29, 2019, approximately five months after he was charged by Complaint. Ignatov met with the Government for nine proffer sessions before entering a guilty plea pursuant to a cooperation agreement. Ignatov continued to meet with the Government after he pled guilty, in primary part so that the Government could prepare Ignatov to testify at the November 2019 trial against coconspirator Mark Scott.

Ignatov testified at that trial over the course of three days. Ignatov provided testimony on the following topics, among other things: (1) background testimony concerning OneCoin, the products offered by OneCoin, and the multilevel marketing structure used by OneCoin; (2) testimony concerning the fraudulent nature of OneCoin; and (3) testimony concerning OneCoin’s issues with banking, and a high-level explanation of how OneCoin solved those issues through the use of a network of money launderers, including Mark Scott.

The defendant was arrested on a complaint on March 6, 2019, and ordered detained. On May 28, 2019, he waived indictment and an information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud was entered.

On October 4, 2019, he waived indictment again, and, pursuant to a cooperation agreement, pleaded to an information charging him with: (1) one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; (2) one count of wire fraud; (3) one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering; and (4) one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. All four counts pertained to the OneCoin scheme.

In November 2019, Ignatov testified as a cooperator at the Scott trial.

On January 29, 2021, Ignatov was bailed. On November 12, 2021, after the Government learned of Ignatov’s perjury at the Scott trial, the defendant was remanded. He was bailed again on November 14, 2022. In total, the defendant has spent approximately 34 months in custody on the charges in this case.

Ignatov is the fifth defendant to be sentenced in the case:

 On October 19, 2021, David Pike was sentenced to a term of probation of two years. Pike’s Guidelines range was 6 to 12 months.
On February 16, 2023, Gilbert Armenta was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 60 months. Armenta’s Guidelines range was 1,200 months. Armenta also entered into a cooperation agreement with the Government, but he committed additional crimes after entering into his cooperation agreement and the Government did not provide him with a Section 5K1.1 letter.
On September 12, 2023, Karl Sebastian Greenwood, a cofounder of the OneCoin scheme, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 240 months. Greenwood’s Guidelines range was 720 months.
On January 25, 2024, Mark Scott was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 120 months. Scott’s Guidelines range was 600 months.
Probation recommends a sentence of time served, and the defendant requested a sentence of time served. The defendant is a citizen of Bulgaria who does not have status in the United States.
