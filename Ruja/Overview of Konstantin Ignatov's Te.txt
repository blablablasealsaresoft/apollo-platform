Overview of Konstantin Ignatov's TestimonyKonstantin Ignatov, the younger brother of OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova, provided significant testimony as a cooperating witness in legal proceedings related to the OneCoin fraud scheme. After his arrest in March 2019 at Los Angeles International Airport, he pleaded guilty in October 2019 to charges including money laundering, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and bank fraud. His cooperation was described as "extraordinary" by prosecutors, which contributed to his lenient sentence of time served (approximately 34 months) in March 2024, despite facing up to 90 years in prison. Ignatov's testimony focused on exposing the inner workings of the $4 billion Ponzi scheme, key meetings, and the roles of other figures like Ruja Ignatova and lawyer Mark Scott. Below are detailed accounts from his testimonies in criminal and civil cases.Testimony in the Criminal Trial of Mark Scott (November 2019)Ignatov was a star witness in the U.S. federal trial of Mark Scott, a former Locke Lord LLP partner accused of laundering $400 million in OneCoin proceeds through fake investment funds. His testimony helped secure Scott's conviction on money laundering and bank fraud charges in November 2019 (Scott was later sentenced to 10 years).Key details from Ignatov's testimony:Meeting with Scott: Ignatov described a 2016 in-person meeting at OneCoin's headquarters in Sofia, Bulgaria, involving himself, Ruja Ignatova, and Scott. During this meeting, Ruja allegedly instructed Scott on his role in the scam, including how to handle and launder investor funds. Ignatov testified that this was part of the scheme's efforts to obscure the fraudulent nature of OneCoin, which had no real blockchain and fabricated token values.

Admissions About the Fraud: Ignatov admitted to his own involvement, including making false representations to investors about OneCoin's structure, value, usability, and future public trading. He confessed to lying about the scheme's legitimacy while running it after Ruja's disappearance in October 2017. For instance, he acknowledged promoting OneCoin to vulnerable populations in poor countries, knowing it was a scam.

Bank Fraud Plea and Cross-Examination: Under cross-examination by Scott's defense attorney Arlo Devlin-Brown, Ignatov admitted to pleading guilty to bank fraud but struggled to name a U.S. FDIC-insured bank he had defrauded, instead mentioning the United Bank of Dubai. This was used by the defense to question his credibility. Ignatov also discussed internal communications and his role in managing investor complaints post-Ruja's vanishing.

Details on Ruja's Disappearance: Ignatov provided insights into Ruja's last known movements, including her trip from Sofia to Athens in October 2017. He testified that her bodyguards reported she was met by "Russian guys" at the airport, and she had previously mentioned knowing a "rich and powerful" person in Russia who could provide protection. This fueled speculation about her ties to organized crime or hiding in Russia.

Scott later appealed his conviction in 2024, arguing that Ignatov perjured himself by falsely claiming he discarded his OneCoin laptop (prosecutors conceded this was untrue) and misrepresenting details of the 2016 meeting. Despite this, the appeal did not overturn the conviction, and Ignatov's overall testimony was pivotal to the government's case.

Agreement to Testify in Civil Lawsuit Against Ruja Ignatova (August 2020)In a class-action civil lawsuit filed by defrauded OneCoin investors against Ruja Ignatova and other associates, Ignatov agreed to testify against his sister in exchange for the dismissal of civil claims against him. This agreement was approved by U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in the Southern District of New York on August 25, 2020.Key aspects:Scope of Testimony: If the case proceeded to trial, Ignatov was required to provide evidence on Ruja's central role in founding and orchestrating the OneCoin scheme, including her false promises about the cryptocurrency's technology and value. This built on his criminal testimony, emphasizing how Ruja directed the fraud from 2014 until her disappearance.

Motivation for Cooperation: The agreement was part of Ignatov's broader bid for leniency in his criminal sentencing. His prior guilty plea and testimony in the Scott trial were cited as evidence of his "instrumental" cooperation in dismantling the scam's network.

Broader Impact and Post-Testimony DevelopmentsIgnatov's testimony revealed OneCoin as a classic Ponzi scheme with no legitimate operations, where investor funds were siphoned for personal gain by leaders like Ruja (who allegedly pocketed billions). He provided documents, emails, and financial records that aided in tracing laundered funds and prosecuting others, such as Irina Dilkinska (OneCoin's head of legal, sentenced to 4 years in 2024).After his release in March 2024, Ignatov has maintained a low profile, with no further public testimonies reported as of January 2026. His cooperation helped recover some assets for victims but drew criticism from them for his light sentence. Ongoing investigations into OneCoin, including German indictments against Ruja in 2025, may reference his accounts, though he has not testified in those proceedings.This information is compiled from court records and news reports; full transcripts may be available via PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) for the Southern District of New York cases.
