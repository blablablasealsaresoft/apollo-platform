# Developer Utilities

Keep day-to-day work fast:
- `scaffold_service.py` – Create a new Apollo microservice skeleton with Dockerfile, README, and CI hook.
- `lint_changed.sh` – Run lint/tests only on files changed vs main.
- `format_imports.py` – Lightweight import sorter for Python files when IDEs are unavailable.
