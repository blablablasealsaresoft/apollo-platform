# Apollo Tooling Suite

This folder keeps operator-friendly tools that make daily work on the Apollo platform faster and safer.  Each subfolder focuses on a different slice of the workflow:

- `ai-tools/` – prompt packs, embeddings helpers, and assistants for AI-driven intelligence work.
- `analytics/` – scripts and notebook-ready utilities for interrogating investigations, telemetry, and performance data.
- `deployment/` – release pipelines, artifact builders, and cluster automation helpers outside of CI.
- `development/` – dev-productivity scripts (project scaffolding, lint helpers, migration generators).
- `security/` – red/blue-team utilities including scanners, exploit simulators, and hardening checklists.

Every tool is self-documented.  Run `python <tool>.py --help` or read the README inside each folder to get going.
