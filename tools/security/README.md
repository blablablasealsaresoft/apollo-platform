# Security Tools

Compact toolkit for offensive + defensive security verification.

- `scan_dependencies.py` – Wraps osv-scanner to audit Python/Node dependencies.
- `recon_proxy.py` – Tiny HTTP proxy that logs investigations of suspect infrastructure.
- `attack_simulator.sh` – Simulates brute-force/login spraying to test alerting pipelines.

Always run inside lab environments.
